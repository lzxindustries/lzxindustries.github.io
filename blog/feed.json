            "content_html": "<p>Hello fellow gray hairs. I've aged 55-175 years since my last update.  Lots to discuss, and not all of it is bad.</p>\n<p>The new tariffs on imports from China started hitting us full force around the time of my last update. For example, in the past, with a small batch assembly order from one of our overseas vendors for $800 or less, we had not been charged any import tariffs.  This meant that outside of the occasional big delivery we could operate as a small business without the tariffs imposed back in January strangling us.</p>\n<p>On April 23rd, logging in to place my usual purchases for PCB assemblies, I see that for the first time a tariffs line has been added at checkout for 175% of the order's value.  My order was for $284.39 and the additional tariffs charge was $497.69!  This is nearly tripling our primary manufacturing expense: most of the cost of an average LZX module is the PCB assembly and the video grade components mounted on it.</p>\n<p>This change forced me to suspend multiple active production projects and temporarily disband the workshop team.  Since then I've been trying to do everything I can to figure out alternative strategies for us.  Thankfully, there are plenty -- the most relevant of which is that we do have an in house SMT assembly machine.  By May 14th (this week), we saw the tariffs surcharge percentage drop from 175% to 55% at our external vendor.  This difference is enough for us to at least push forward, by only ordering the PCBs but doing all the assembly work here.</p>\n<p>We are going to assume that we'll be paying a 55% surcharge on any purchasing from China right now. For us in the short term that is going to apply directly to PCBs and SMT assembly stencils.  We're going to switch entirely back to in house SMT assembly, which means increased costs of assembly wages and inventory management (but not as much as paying tariffs on these items.)  The effect of which is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Effective June 1st, we will raise the pricing on all EuroRack modules and EuroRack modular systems by 20%.</li>\n<li>There may be gaps of availability in some products this year as we pivot to new processes. We will be disabling backorders for any items temporarily going out of production after their next or in-progress batches.</li>\n<li>Pricing on Chromagnon, the Vessel case, cables and other accessories, and power related products like DC Distro will remain the same.</li>\n<li>You can purchase anything on our webstore at the current pricing until May 31st.</li>\n<li>The shorter term cashflow really helps us right now, so please do not feel guilty for jumping in before the prices go up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amidst the scramble over the past month, I have still been pursuing my efforts to guide Chromagnon in for landing.  Part of that is making some careful and informed decisions regarding the reality of manufacturing it smoothly, and how that will integrate into the evolving supply chain equation.  Here is what that looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We're not going to invest in injection mold tooling for Chromagnon's cases and molded parts, and will pursue alternative means of producing these pieces. This will cost a bit more in the long term, as we switch to more expensive processes and domestic vendors, but it will allow us to ease smoothly into fulfillment without hiccups and without sacrificing the quality of the end product.</li>\n<li>The Chromagnon standalone enclosure will be upgraded from injection molded part to a single piece sheet metal design.  There will be a rear chicklet PCB that adapts the modular style power and sync connectors to the rear of the case.  Here's a look at it:\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon-sheet-metal-boat-preview-53aaa376f879ca7529c71ac23d359c02.png\" width=\"2087\" height=\"1422\" class=\"img_ev3q\">\n<em>Rendering of sheet metal boat part for Chromagnon</em></li>\n<li>From the launch date, there will be separate SKUs and prices for the module alone, or the module in its standalone enclosure.  Everyone with a current preorder gets the enclosure as expected.</li>\n<li>We will use our existing Gen3 parts and suitable off the shelf options for control knobs, rather than custom molded parts, in order to guarantee proper fit and no production flow issues.</li>\n<li>Custom button caps and the LED light grid will be combined into a single piece sprue that will be 3D printed by an industrial service in production quality resins. Check out the last posts about knobs early 2024 if you want to see what that looks like.</li>\n<li>We won't be adding a cooling fan or a big rear panel.  The architecture of the core board is changing away from a big integrated FPGA to testable submodules using FPGAs that are lower cost and don't require any cooling.  This means Chromagnon as a module will maintain the same mounting depth as other Gen3 modules.</li>\n<li>We will be launching Chromagnon fulfillment simultaneously with a new device that can work with Chromagnon as a companion, and offers a unique standalone featureset itself.  This is something we've had in development since the release of Scrolls, and it's something we've mentioned in the past.  But we'll save any details for later this Summer.  In any case, it will be Chromagnon's co-pilot in helping fulfillment start and progress strongly.  Our strategy involves these two products sharing similar production lines, so that any new sales help us ship Chromagnons faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a lot of these decisions made, I am able to wrap up the Chromagnon core board project -- I'll write to you again when that job is done, and when I can show you a photo of the new enclosure piece, toward the end of May.  I believe we have a clear path to launching Chromagnon fulfillment this Summer, and despite recent obstacles, this makes me very happy.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>It has been a highly productive past month here at LZX HQ, despite many ups and downs.  We've made a big progress push on Chromagnon with new PCB designs for subassemblies and their test boards, we've got PRM kits in stock, and we've published another round of content for our docs website.</p>\n<p>The current political climate and new tariffs imposed on imports from China have us heavily concerned for everything we do here.  We received a tax bill in the past month that was several times higher than anything we've seen before. Those of you who have been following our company for a while know that we follow a market price methodology to pricing our products, which means that what you pay for them is a direct product of the hard costs involved in parts and labor -- in other words, if the cost of the parts go up, the price will need to go up at some point as well.  We aren't there yet, as we're hoping the situation will change.  If you've been looking at picking up some modules, it is a good time to get in before that happens.  We will honor all orders and backorders at the current pricing levels.</p>\n<p>If you've been following along with Chromagnon, we've been pushing for over a year on a fully integrated single board solution designed to finalize the Chromagnon design so that it can enter production.  We've been stuck at a stasis point on the next revision of that board for a few month, as you all are holding the line without much news.  I've realized that the integrated single board approach has been holding us back from finalizing the design, and that the lost time in sealing the design is costing us more than time spent on alternative approaches -- such as the modular subassemblies we were working on earlier in the project.  We've decided to pick up that thread and make a move toward a new version of the subassemblies, and integrating them into the next revision of the core.  This will ensure that we cut no corners when it comes to precision and stability, even though it will raise our production costs and labor when it comes time for production.</p>\n<p>I'm happy to say that this effort has been a great success -- we've designed, built and validated 5 different submodules and their test boards in the past month.  The test boards allow us to calibrate and test each submodule before installation on the main assembly.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon-subassemblies-5be7a5db5b5c84b870d017bab5ec9b1c.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"760\" class=\"img_ev3q\">\n<em>Modular subassemblies</em></p>\n<p>Pictured above you can see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FQM-REVC, a quad multiplier submodule. This circuit is an enhanced derivative of the venerable MC1494 multiplier topology, optimized for video transmission and bandwidths.  It has individual trimming points for null, bias and gain.</li>\n<li>DEC-REVA, a fully encapsulated decoder/encoder submodule designed to transform CVBS and Component video inputs into 1V RGB signals.</li>\n<li>FWR-REVA, a quad rectifier submodule.  This circuit leverages the enhanced performance of our new P series rectifier, and will ensure that Chromagnon's shape generation functions do not produce distortions around the mirror thresholds of diamonds and other shapes.</li>\n<li>FQA-REVA, a quad active attenuverter submodule.  This circuit is a revision of our classic null gap active video attenuverter design.</li>\n<li>HGA-REVA, a quad high gain clipping amp submodule.  The test board is shown, but the assemblies are missing in this photo.  This design provides high gain amplification of an input signal, with the integrated limiting amplifier clipping the outputs.  It has a few uses, but soft key generation is the most obvious one.  This is a new revision of circuits from Doorway, Staircase/Stairs, and Topogram.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/fqm-revc-3cf26e5050747f35f192ed64fc7d1afe.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1001\" class=\"img_ev3q\">\n<em>A closer look at FQM-REVC</em></p>\n<p>The best part of these submodules testing well, is that we are much closer to done!! We have one more submodule design in progress, and then the next revision of the Chromagnon Core RevI can be completed -- with most of the circuitry moved to these submodules, the next Chromnagnon core board revision will go fast rather than being another tedious revision of a giant board.  I look forward to providing an update on that in the next update.</p>\n<p>Our content designers have been plowing through the massive amounts of documentation required for our new docs website, and we've just published an update that includes baseline content for the remaining Gen3 modules without proper user manuals.  We'll be adding more illustrations and written content to this over time: <a href=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/module-list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/module-list</a></p>\n<p>After getting held up in customs, we finally have some kits in stock for our Precision Rectifier &amp; Multipler (PRM) module.  This module is a basic ingredient of video synth functions, and the number of functions you can patch with it is a long list.  Read about them on the docs website here: <a href=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/prm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/prm</a></p>\n<p>Times are tough for the whole industry of USA based synth makers right now.  It is with undying gratitude that we thank you for helping us keep the dream alive here at LZX Industries.</p>",

Following the release of this version, I expect to move into fulfillment plans and scheduling. I'm currently weighing a few options which will have a big impact on how that all goes, and playing catch up on projects delayed in January and February.  The pace at which progress can be made with Chromagnon is set by the health of our sales and the synth industry in general, and this year has started roughly in that regard.  Despite that, I remain confident that LZX and Chromagnon will pull through strongly.</p>\n<p>After a year's hiatus, we released our first new module in November last year: PGO.  We now have five more in this series available, in what we are calling the P series: modules which fit one of the three themes: Passive, Precision or Programmable.  P Series functions are not complex, exciting video effects on an individual basis: they are the building blocks of them. Those of you who wish to dig into the nuts and bolts of analog graphics will find that all the right operators are here to patch most of the functions in our other modules.  As we consider revising earlier modules and developing  new modules, this series provides a chance to encapsulate our best practices in video synth module design thus far, and provide a solid foundation on which to do so.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/p-series-rack-3888e60077212e7adbdc88619dd45cbb.jpg\" width=\"4075\" height=\"3056\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>PROGRAMMABLE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PGO: 4HP Programmable Gain &amp; Offset</li>\n<li>PAB: 4HP Programmable Active Buffers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PRECISION</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PRM: 4HP Precision Rectifier &amp; Multiplier</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PASSIVE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MLT: 8HP Passive Multiples</li>\n<li>LNK: 4HP Passive Links</li>\n<li>P: 2HP Passive Potentiometer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All P Series modules are available in 3 variants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully assembled, including any power cables</li>\n<li>Full DIY kit, all parts included</li>\n<li>Partial DIY kit, SMT assemblies and frontpanels only</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have stock of all variants available now, except PRM -- we'll have those added to stock soon.

            "content_html": "<p>Greetings from Portland, video friends. January (and now most of February) have delivered some frustrating setbacks for both work and personal life.  We had our furnace in the home/workshop go out for 10 days in January, followed by me getting sick for a couple of weeks.  This kept me off the Chromagnon workbench, but I used the time to make more progress with the firmware.</p>\n<p>Currently in the workshop we're scrambling to build the last few module restocks required to put a few Double Vision systems on the shelf.  If you want one, they will be available soon!</p>\n<p>The Chromagnon Core RevH board has been reviewed, and I'm now making a few changes for RevI.  Since I'm aiming for this to be the production version, I'm being careful to review every line item on the BOM against current supply chain availability, and find alternates for a few components that are more costly than they need to be.</p>\n<p>During my firmware sprint in January, I wrote a desktop app which communicates over USB with our hardware, allowing remote settings editing and monitoring.  This is a big feature boost for Chromagnon, as it means I can enable user control over many advanced settings that aren't accessible via the frontpanel or Chromagnon's rear 16-position DIP switch.  I have been integrating the communications library into other projects as well, and the plan is to release the desktop application as a general purpose utility for interacting with all of the LZX embedded hardware in greater detail.</p>\n<p>Jonah and I have also been wrapping up the details on a few new modules that have been in development, and trying to \"close all our open tabs\" in this regard. Here's a list of modular projects we've finalizing.</p>\n<p>Analog Computing Operators</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PGO, Programmable Gain &amp; Offset (4HP) - available now!</li>\n<li>PRM, Precision Rectifier &amp; Multiplier (4HP)</li>\n<li>PAB, Programmable Active Buffers (4HP)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Passive Utilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MLT, Passive Multiples (8HP)</li>\n<li>LNK, Passive Links (4HP)</li>\n<li>P, Passive Potentiomter (2HP)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other Projects</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New video encoder designs, including digital outputs</li>\n<li>A slim new audio envelope/low frequency event generator module</li>\n<li>Expedition Mk2 releases such as a new War of the Ants and Sensory Translator</li>\n<li>EuroRack +/-12V power supply expanders for the Vessel 168/Vessel 84 cases.</li>\n<li>The Vessel 208 case, which will feature a high quality latching lid for travel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also in the past few weeks I have been working with graphic designer Ramin Rahni, who has been developing illustrations for the Gen3 modules for our documentation website we launched with PGO back in October. I'd also like to shout out Gary MacLeod, a community member who has helped immensely with solving issues with our website -- which now loads much faster, and has better product galleries.  We have Aaron Ross, a beloved community member and instructional designer, lined up to help with content editing and development too.  I'm very grateful for the opportunity to work with these pros in a bartered exchange for modules -- as our budgets are quite slim going into Chromagnon season.</p>\n<p>In parting, I received a note recently that expressed frustration over having not received an apology for the run-on-sentence that has been the Chromagon project timeline.  To be clear and quite frank: I am deeply sorry for the wait, and I take full and unequivocal responsibility for it. I feel the sorriness of it deep in my bones each night as I'm trying fall asleep.  I feel it deep in my gut every time I pause to think about the number of artists who made a purchase with their budget for creative equipment they do not yet have in their hands.  This project has been the exact opposite of the scenario I wanted with LZX, and the biggest project planning/timing blunder I've ever made in my life.  I also feel quite guilty I can't just lock myself in a room 24/7 until it's done -- the business has to be run, kids have to eat, rent has to be paid, so products still have to be developed alongside.  I'm continuously rotating through projects, and moving Chromagnon forward with as many resources as I can give it.  I'm really looking forward to delivering on the promise of this device, and ending this chapter in our shared story.  Despite it all, thank you for believing in the dream of Chromagnon. You have all been very understanding and I owe you my gratitude. I can't speak for all of you, but I know for some it will have been more than worth the wait.</p>\n<p>Love and light, I look forward to writing again soon,</p>\n<p>Lars</p>",

It is our fifteenth year of offering tools to you, and our eighteenth year of developing analog video synthesizers. I feel very excited about our point of view on our existing and future projects at LZX, and 2025 should be fun year.</p>\n<p>The requested Chromagnon recap:  2024 started off strong, with the launch of this production blog, and a new redesign of the Chromagnon Core assembly: RevF.  This assembly was designed to put all the remaining assembly work onto a single board, so that we could finally start shipping the project.  Our plans moved strongly thru the RevF review, but there were still several functional changes that needed to be made.  Then we got hit with the unexpected: sales slowed drastically this year, forcing us to downsize.</p>\n<p>Moving into the Summer, we lost a few months of Chromagnon time scrambling to update processes and keep the business flowing.  By the end of the Summer, this task was done, and the second Chromagnon revision for the year was in review: RevG.  During the late Summer and into the Fall I wrote Chromagnon's firmware, as RevG was complete enough to write all the firmware functionality.  But there were still a few issues to resolve with the hardware, so in October I heavily into the RevH revisions.  With this revision, we also needed to integrate Chromagnon into our workflow outsourcing SMT assemblies.</p>\n<p>The RevH order was sent in November, and review of the RevH prototype has been ongoing (and successful) since early December, with a couple of bumps in the road that required us to pick it up and put it back down a couple of times while waiting for parts. So, going well, but not going fast. The review is almost complete, and after it's done I'll make another blog post about what's next. We are close to our \"ship unit one\" milestone, which is when a complete hardware unit goes to a beta tester. That might be RevH, or it may be RevI -- not positive yet.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon-revh-0601e386fe3353c3bd28a4402e14bc83.jpg\" width=\"2576\" height=\"1932\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>What else did we do in 2024?

The next update will focus on that -- in this one I wanted to provide a few updates about projects we are working on to keep the company running as we get through the final milestones with Chromagnon.</p>\n<p>The first is a new module, PGO, a 4HP Programmable Gain &amp; Offset processor, which is now available.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-modules-workbench-ffc0049e38aaaebd3fc85da024c04315.jpg\" width=\"4080\" height=\"3060\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-diy-kits-77ee5d7a6dfbfeeb3611c8fbaa32f312.jpg\" width=\"3517\" height=\"2717\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-module-box-056fb359ad03b859448bc27084b360be.jpg\" width=\"3060\" height=\"4080\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>This module is the first in a new series of modules titled P Series, which will focus on core utility modules that are available in both assembled and DIY forms.  We have also used PGO to prototype a more complete approach to our product documentation, and you can see what that looks like here at <a href=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/pgo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/pgo</a>.  P Series can be considered the successor to Cadet series, as well as Expedition modules providing raw functions, such as Bridge and Arch. We have a few more planned, and we'll release them over the upcoming months.</p>\n<p>PGO may not appeal to every video synthesist -- it is a raw function, and is the kind of module you can use as a building block in patching more complex custom functions. For myself, I'm very excitd to have 16 of them in their own rack, and using that rack for future development ideas.  For existing Gen3 owners, you could use it this way -- or in a few other contexts as well.  Check out the docs linked above for more on that topic.</p>\n<p>In other news, we have a few new variations for the Double Vision System available.  The first is the option to purchase Double Vision with our 168HP modular case, allowing 84HP of empty space to grow into.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/double-vision-system-6u-19adf8ece2e7f769b8fc333482a2fa52.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"547\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>The second is an expanded Double Vision system including 168HP of Gen3 modules.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/double-vision-system-168-4553df7d6780c63e56c97473bdafbd80.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"547\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>The third is an expander for existing Double Vision owners, allowing you to upgrade your existing Double Vision to the 168HP and 84HP of new modules.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/double-vision-expander-168-6da7f296e071e8e98c29dd819773a1ac.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"547\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>We have stock of these variants available now.</p>\n<p>Let's answer your questions!</p>\n<p><em>Van Ta asked, \"Those 4Q multiplier submodules from the last entry look really exciting. Are you planning to sell them as well for DIYers?\"</em></p>\n<p>I'd like to!  I'm not sure what form that will take yet, in light of the P Series DIY modules, and our next development plans. The next P Series module is a programmable comparator, switch, and multiplier combo function. Since it is a 4HP module, I'm going with an IC based multiplier for the first prototype. The discrete cell designs are probably most practical in the context of a DIY rotator or matrix multiplier module. If I don't do something specific with the boards I developed, I will consider releasing the designs so others can dig in.</p>\n<p><em>Asjave asked, \"Does the Double Vision system have everything in the Chromagnon and more, or are there features in Chromagnon that don't exist in the Double-Vision system? Thank you!\"</em></p>\n<p>Double Vision and Chromagnon are entirely different video synthesizers, with different internal functions.  They are similar in that they can both process an SD/HD analog video signal, and perform various shape generation, pattern synthesis, feedback, and colorization effects.  But the specifics are quite different.  The biggest functional add for Double Vision is its open ended patchability and being able to mix and process two external video sources.  You could consider Chromagnon a <em>video processor</em>, and Double Vision a <em>video mixer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Sig asked, \"Any chance the new TBC2 VGA expander comes with an EDID chip? If not, would you consider this for a future version? I think it would be a really nice feature.\"</em></p>\n<p>Hi Sig, no -- the VGA expander doesn't have an EDID chip, but that is an interesting proposal.  In its current architecture, TBC2 is designed to auto-detect the incoming video format and, if supported, lock to it. An EDID chip would allow the transmitting device to read the supported input formats and present those as valid options to the user.  Since you can see the supported TBC2 input formats in our documentation, you should be able to configure your device appropriately as it is -- but I can understand why the EDID chip would be a nice thing to have.</p>\n<p><em>Pat said, \"Hi! I just finished reading the latest monthly journal entry (November). It sounds like you guys are making some great progress but I'm a little confused with all the technical talk and where Chromagnon sits along the timeline of being finished. Would it be possible to include some type of metric in each post for the layman? Say, like a percentage of completion where 100% means the unit is ready to ship? I appreciate all the details but it's hard for me to figure out what it all means in the big picture.\"</em></p>\n<p>I understand -- I appreciate that the jargon may be frustrating to read when you are looking for an answer to a simple question. At the beginning of the year on January 5th's blog, I outlined 3 milestones to completing this project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Production ready</li>\n<li>Ship unit one</li>\n<li>Ship all pre-orders</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since there are so many moving pieces involved in the project, it would be difficult to quantify <em>percentage complete</em> in terms of the overall ongoing project.  For example, most of the production work is already done, since Chromagnon's control board assembly went into production back in 2021-2022. Going into this year, the \"Production ready\" milestone includes finalizing parts design, PCB design, and firmware.  Compared to where we were in January, parts design is 100% done, PCB design is <em>pending</em> 100% done, and firmware is 95% done.  We were at this state back in August too, but the most recent PCB design needed more work, and it took a few weeks to make that revision.  So in other words, <em>if</em> no more hardware revisions are neccessary on this incoming prototype -- we will be moving past the Production ready milestone finally, before the end of the year.  The leap from Production Ready to Ship Unit One is not so big, and much easier to estimate. It will happen right after production ready, as most of the tasks involved in prepping for that next milestone have already been completed.  I hope this helps you understand better where we are with the project.</p>\n<p><em>Dan asked, \"Do you think Chromagnon will be shipping by Christmas 2024?\"</em></p>\n<p>It is quite possible we will reach the Ship Unit One milestone (see above reply to Pat) before the end of the year. Sometime in December, after reviewing the next incoming PCB prototype, I will know for sure.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading -- please write in using this form if you have questions: <a href=\"https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA</a></p>",

Rather than sending them to the junk, we've been making progress over the Sumer on building up a limited batch of 24 units using those parts.

After this last prototype review, the full context is a lot easier to see, including the remaining steps needed until we're actually placing the order for production core boards and molded parts. This process has been grueling, as the core board's BOM and parts count are massive. Thus, I've been breaking some repetitive parts of the analog circuit into submodules.</p>\n<p>The first of those submodules is a four quadrant multiplier sub-assembly that encapsulates our discrete design. This design is based on topologies in classic multiplier ICs such as MC1494 and MC1495, which are long obsolete.  A core requirement of the Chromagnon design is the implementation of this discrete multiplier, as there are over 20 of them in its analog circuit!  We've been working on this circuit since before Chromagnon was even conceived, and after so many revisions I'm very pleased with how it is performing.  Here's a look at the submodule.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/submodule-5044199d99470952d22aa4fe9987c5c1.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"265\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>This submodule is being reintegrated into Chromagnon's core board, which reduces the BOM count by a few hundred parts and will allow pre-testing/calibration of the analog circuit. We have already received our initial order of these submodules and are testing them now.</p>\n<p>Revisions to Chromagnon Core RevH will be ordered by the end of this week.  I'm not used to spending entire weeks on a single PCB layout, so that gives you an idea of the scale of the effort required to push this forward. This is the first version of the board that is being 100% assembled out of our workshop, which means we're priming it to be ready to go, and it is a candidate for production.  I'd love to have it all confirmed and initial quantities ordered by the end of October -- there's not a lot left to stand in our way of that happening.</p>\n<p>And now, here are answers to the questions you have submitted since the last update:</p>\n<p><strong>Marty asked, \"Looking forward to shipping on Chromagnon. Well done on all the work so far. When shipping does occur. Will the cost of the unit, detailed for customs. Reflect the date of purchase or current value? I'm just worried about the extra tax I'm going to pay when it ships to Australia.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Hi, Marty. The customs info will reflect the price you paid on your original sales invoice.</p>\n<p><strong>Pat asked, \"Can we expect Chromagnon unit #1 to ship out by Halloween?\"</strong></p>\n<p>Probably not, Pat!  In the next Chromagnon milestone, I'm hoping to be telling you we've got RevH confirmed and have ordered initial production parts. That is getting very close, and would mean we have unit #1 here. Whether or not it's shipping by that date, I don't know -- firmware is about 95% done, but there's still a few items to wrap up and test once the hardware is sealed.</p>\n<p><strong>Paul asked, \"Would it be possible to demonstrate through your LZX documentation learning program, the placement and attachment of modules into a Vessel or eurorack case? And if any modules have to be linked together or sync. This is for those who don’t know. Thank you.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Hi Paul. Yes, certainly! We do have a basic guide to doing this on our website at <a href=\"https://lzxindustries.net/getting-started\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://lzxindustries.net/getting-started</a>. However, I'd love to expand on that and have some videos and better photos to go along with it.</p>\n<p>Until next time,\nLars</p>",

At it's core, it is an analog synthesizer with a fully analog, wideband signal path -- but also, there is a complex digital embedded system which handles the user interface, video input decoding and scaling (SD to HD and HD to SD), and 10-bit ramp waveform generation.</p>\n<p>For the digital system, we are using a System-on-Module from MYiR, which you can read more about here. This is based on the Xilinx Zynq system on chip -- the same as employed on your Zybo board.  Xilinx FPGAs are used heavily in broadcast and imaging applications of all kinds. On our host board, we use video encoding and decoding interface ICs such as the ADV7181C, ADV7123 and ADV7125 for interfacing analog video with the Zynq IO ports. I hope you have fun with the Zybo board!</p>\n<p>Talk to you again soon,\nLars</p>",

Approaching these instruments, I had many firmware and software projects behind me – but none at this level of structural complexity.  So I was surprised by the scale of what I still needed to learn with regards to architectural patterns and systems level design. Hardware scales easily – five circuits is five circuits – but in software, writing a state control system for five asynchronous modules is a different beast entirely.  The experience has definitely kindled a love for embedded development with modern C++ in general, and I look forward to doing more of it. During the past few weeks of getting cozy with Chromagnon’s digital brain, I felt both confident and effective, and that was a relief.</p>\n<p>What’s next? With firmware in place, we are able to move into a new verification process for the instrument as a whole.  That’s a long list of tests, including nearly 200 different video input conversion modes – in addition to all combinations of Chromagnon’s 12 compositor modes, 3 chroma modes, 3 luma modes, and 4 primary modes. Most of this testing has already been done with prior versions of the hardware, but we still need to repeat the tests now that we have a firmware candidate.

The main difference being that Mk2 will support HD modes.</p>\n<p><strong>Mat asked, \"Just curious about the timeframe in regards to the Double Vision preorder. Will there be a long wait? I just ordered recently and will hopefully not have to wait as long as I have for the Chromagnon.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Since we launched the Double Vision system bundle, the average wait time for a shipment has been about 3 weeks.  I expect that to stay consistent.  We have a good flow coming thru the workshop of stocking the module sets in small batches. Your Double Vision is actually in QC today, and planning to ship tomorrow.  You sent in this question on July 15th, so that seems pretty consistent with the average lead time.</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas asked, \"Are preorders for the Chromagnon still open? Nothing happens when I press the preorder button, and I see people selling their preorder slots online.  Am I too late to buy one?\"</strong></p>\n<p>Preorders are open. If you click the preorder button on the product page, you should see it added to your shopping cart (but the site doesn't automatically take you there.)  This is not a limited edition -- the date we have Chromagnons in stock and all preorders are fulfilled is still uncertain, but you don't need to worry about missing out.  We hope to keep the instrument in production for many years.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick said, \"It seems like a lot is happening over there right now, and there are many updates and things to discuss in each monthly journal post. Is there any inclination to get back to doing a weekly journal post to keep us more in the loop? Or would that slow production down because it's another thing to think about? Either way, I'm glad Chromagnon is still being worked on. Since June has come and gone, is there any new estimate for when the first unit might ship out?\"</strong></p>\n<p>Patrick, I'm sorry the updates have been less frequent.  Currently the core team is down to myself full time and three part timers.  Writing these blog posts is no huge burden, but it does take 2-3 hours out of my work week each time. With hardware development and workshop projects, tasks are shorter -- 1 to 16 hrs each -- to do a board layout, or revision, or build a prototype.  With software or circuit design it's often 3-6 week sprints, during which it can be difficult for me to do anything but write code or run simulations.  With code sprints in the rear window for now, I'll try to up the pace of the updates.  I'm hoping to be past hardware verification and on to production and user docs soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Kazys asked, \"How effective is Chromagnon with a Vectrex? Can it do Rutt-Etra style rescanning into X / Y / Z out of the box?\"</strong></p>\n<p>We have not recorded any Vectrex monitor tests yet, and that should be the final judge of this -- but you've got the right idea. The scaler decimation settings allow you to output low frequency rasters for lower bandwidth displays, like laser projectors and the Vectrex. I expect some of the middle settings to be right for use with the Vectrex -- a raster size of 120x68, for example.</p>\n<p><strong>Kazys also asked, \"If I have a Chromagnon, why would I need an ESG3? Is it still useful?\"</strong></p>\n<p>Definitely. Chromagnon has no dedicated RGB level or offset controls, so ESG3 would add a lot, with each of ESG3's six knobs and three switches representing parameters not present on Chromagnon.  Another reason to have an ESG3 is if you are using Chromagnon in the context of a modular system, and want to mix it's output with other sources before the final output.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about hardware development, software development, LZX, or you just need someone to talk to, write to me here:  <a href=\"https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lars</li>\n</ul>",

I wanted to reach this milestone before I wrote a new blog, as it represents my exit from the Code Cave and back into the workshop.  So let my eyeballs readjust – this blog will mostly be about the software.",
