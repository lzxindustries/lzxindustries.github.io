<p>What's up next for LZX? This year has required some massive juggling of our priorities in response to the fluctuating new tariffs, which have effectively demolished our plans going into this year. We were hoping to be shipping Chromagnon by the end of the Summer, but have spent most of the past few months scrambling to figure out how we are going to continue making our products. We have been doing a lot of assessment and planning in August, and despite it all, we remain optimistic about the road ahead.</p>
<p><em>Going into September,</em> we are finishing a large number of in house production projects, and will be caught up on backorders made over the Summer.</p>
<p><em>By the end of September,</em> our new multi-effects console, Videomancer, will be in production.  During this time we will be polishing the firmware release for Videomancer while also revising Chromagnon hardware to implement new circuits that were designed and validated for Videomancer.  This Chromagnon redesign is essential, as the new tariffs made our previously planned approach impossible.</p>
<p><em>By the end of October,</em> we will be shipping Videomancer units.  Sales will initially be limited to whatever we have been able to build or already have in production.  By your request, Chromagnon pre-order customers will be e-mailed a code to allow early access to purchases of Videomancer a few days before the public launch date.</p>
<p><em>In early November,</em> we will be validating and writing firmware for the revised Chromagnon hardware.  We plan to share a lot of media as we go through this phase.</p>
<p><em>By the end of December,</em> we expect to have the redesigned build of Chromagnon ready to go into assembly and fulfillment in 2026.</p>
<p><em>How fast will Chromagnon fulfillment happen?</em>  By the time we hit the hardware/firmware milestones mentioned above, we will be able to assess our position on this better.  But there are two ways we expect it could go.  If we are doing strongly after the sales season, we will build Chromagnon in large batches, outsourcing extra help, and hoping to ship all orders in 1-3 waves of shipments.  If that is not possible, we will be integrating Chromagnon into our existing production workflows and start making monthly shipments of a variable number of units dependent on our logistical constraints at the time. With the global economy in flux right now, we don't have a way to forecast this accurately.  This may be a year without many video synthesizers under the tree, just due to the general instability of the global market right now.</p>
<p>Here are a few images to share from Videomancer development.  This must be considered a behind-the-scenes slideshow, so please don't take anything you see here as a final answer (especially the UI mockup.)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello eyeball friends -- I'm taking a break from an intense development sprint to say thank you for your support and patience over the past month, as we shift activities and processes in response to the tariffs on most of the parts we use in production.  We have the in house SMT machine running the past couple weeks and are making headway on your recent backorders.</p>
<p>I've alluded to a plan unfolding regarding Chromagnon and a new companion product that will launch alongside it this year, after some revisions which synergize the embedded digital systems used on both.  Our previous plan was <em>ship unit one and then work out the production details</em> and now it has become <em>ship the first 100 units alongside the first 100 units of the new product.</em>  If things go according to plan, this twin effort will bring the business back into good shape, after suffering some tumultuous years with Chromagnon's tardiness and the lack of our more popular standalone products in the catalog, like Vidiot and Memory Palace.  The shared embedded infrastructure is what I've been working on all Summer so far, on top of coordinating more production in house.</p>
<p>I've prepared a slideshow below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon_core-88301528483c771025106b65c8afddb8.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This is the Chromagnon Core, the board I've been working on since its major revision in early 2024.  With what you see here, the new analog submodules we discussed earlier this year, and the embedded system project -- we have all the pieces to the puzzle validated and optimized.  This board is getting changes integrated and the parts list is undergoing a detailed review.  The date at which this is all ready might be variable by several weeks, but becomes easier to estimate as I get closer.</p>
<p>We have been working for years on more modular embedded systems for FPGA video processing, and that's the focus of the companion product. which we have named Videomancer.  Here are some photos leading up to where we are with it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/tbc2x_prototype-a0aa7f11d62ed3105b5c299886c55951.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This was the first attempt after TBC2 at making the platform more modular, from around 2022 -- it runs the TBC2 firmware, but was never developed beyond that.  Instead we realized HDMI IO and availability as a standalone product would be necessary for this next step.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/analog_to_hdmi_test_platform-2126b029160e07eaabcf61a940a7c8f3.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This was our first test board for a minimal system designed to convert Analog signals to HDMI.  I did not get very far with it, but enough to lead into the next step.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/evs39_revb_prototype-c4c6df4d32e337f043eac7821080e163.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I couldn't find the first EVS39-REVA board to show you, but here is the second revision of it -- a standalone video processor with minimal IO.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/videomancer_prototype-34b918884ea7c6517c9827e061acfab1.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This led us to what is now production ready hardware for Videomancer in it's latest prototype.  After validating all of the circuits are working properly, the system on Videomancer's core board is being integrated on the Chromagnon core, replacing the previous Zynq SoC based platform.  This means both devices will be able to run off of a shared firmware infrastructure -- and all of that is looking beautiful.</p>
<p>As the Summer moves on, we'd love to hear more from you about your current and ongoing video art projects.  E-mail us or hang out with us in social media and let us know what you're working on!</p>
<p>Hopefully you can make it to <a href="https://videosync.xyz/portland2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Sync in Portland, OR on Aug 15th-17th</a>?  I will be giving a talk on my journey to developing the set of analog operators for video synthesis used in P-Series.</p>
<p>Love and light,
Lars</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A quick update as we wrap up May. Pricing revisions for all modules and modular systems go into effect tomorrow, June 1st.</p>
<p>Sheet metal parts for Chromagnon and its companion project are looking great! We're revising and preparing initial production orders.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/sheet_metal_prototypes-4f07f10a310114ee30562f659381ba1a.jpg" width="3358" height="2618" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The current focus is on software/hardware testing and revisions to the PCB assemblies.  We've been stuck here for a while, on Chromagnon, but are now making strides.  The outcome of this phase will be ordering the revised Chromagnon Core PCB, and the focus right now is on eliminating any variables that might compromise this next version's viability for immediate production.  That comes in the form of writing software driver tests for new parts we are using, further testing of the subassemblies we've developed, optimizing parts selections for cost and supply chain variance, PCB layout revisions, and so forth.</p>
<p>At some point tomorrow I'll update the webstore pricing -- if you place an order before then, the price you paid at checkout will be honored.</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your orders placed over the past two weeks, and the kind words of support as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello fellow gray hairs. I've aged 55-175 years since my last update.  There is a lot to discuss, and not all of it is bad.</p>
<p>The new tariffs on imports from China started hitting us full force around the time of my last update. For example, in the past with a small batch assembly order under $800 from one of our overseas vendors, we had not been charged any import tariffs.  This meant that outside of the occasional big delivery we could operate as a small business without the tariffs (imposed back in January) strangling us.</p>
<p>On April 23rd, logging in to place my usual purchases for PCB assemblies, I see that a tariffs line has been added at checkout for 175% of the order's value. My order was for $284.39 and the additional tariffs charge was $497.69!  This is nearly tripling our primary manufacturing expense. Most of the cost of an average LZX module is the PCB assembly and the video grade components mounted on it.</p>
<p>This change forced me to suspend multiple active production projects and temporarily disband the workshop team.  Since then I've been trying to do everything I can to figure out alternative strategies for LZX. Thankfully, there are plenty -- the most relevant of which is that we do have an in house SMT assembly machine. On May 14th the tariffs surcharge percentage dropped from 175% to 55% at our external vendor. This difference is enough for us to at least push forward, by only ordering the PCBs and doing all the assembly work here at LZX HQ.</p>
<p>We must assume that we'll be paying a 55% surcharge on any purchasing from China from now on (unless after this 90 day "pause" on tariffs they go up again). For LZX in the short term, the 55% tariff is going to apply directly to PCBs and SMT assembly stencils.  We're going to switch entirely back to in house SMT assembly, which means increased costs of assembly wages and inventory management (but not as much as paying tariffs on these items).  The effect of which is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective June 1st, we will increase the pricing on all EuroRack modules and EuroRack modular systems by 20%.</li>
<li>There may be gaps of availability in some products this year as we pivot to new processes. We will be disabling backorders for any items temporarily going out of production after their next or current batches.</li>
<li>Pricing on Chromagnon, the Vessel case, cables, accessories, and power related products (like DC Distro) will remain the same.</li>
<li>You can purchase anything on our webstore at the current pricing until May 31st.</li>
<li>The shorter term cashflow really helps us right now, so please do not feel guilty for making purchases before the prices go up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amidst the scramble of the past month, I have continued to pursue my efforts to guide Chromagnon in for landing. Part of that is making some careful and informed decisions regarding the reality of manufacturing it smoothly, and how that will integrate into the evolving supply chain equation. Here is what that looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're not going to invest in injection mold tooling for Chromagnon's cases and molded parts, and will pursue alternative means of producing these pieces. This will cost a bit more in the long term, as we switch to more expensive processes and domestic vendors, but it will allow us to ease smoothly into fulfillment without hiccups and without sacrificing the quality of the end product.</li>
<li>The Chromagnon standalone enclosure will be upgraded from injection molded part to a single piece sheet metal design.  There will be a rear chicklet PCB that adapts the modular style power and sync connectors to the rear of the case.  Here's a look at it:
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon-sheet-metal-boat-preview-53aaa376f879ca7529c71ac23d359c02.png" width="2087" height="1422" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Rendering of sheet metal boat part for Chromagnon</em></li>
<li>From the launch date, there will be separate SKUs and prices for the module alone, or the module in its standalone enclosure.  Everyone with a current preorder gets the enclosure as expected.</li>
<li>We will use our existing Gen3 parts and suitable off the shelf options for control knobs, rather than custom molded parts, in order to guarantee proper fit and no production flow issues.</li>
<li>Custom button caps and the LED light grid will be combined into a single piece sprue that will be 3D printed by an industrial service in production quality resins. Check out the last posts about knobs early 2024 if you want to see what that looks like.</li>
<li>We won't be adding a cooling fan or a big rear panel. The architecture of the core board is changing away from a big integrated FPGA to testable submodules using FPGAs that are lower cost and don't require any cooling.  This means Chromagnon as a module will maintain the same mounting depth as other Gen3 modules.</li>
<li>We will be launching Chromagnon fulfillment simultaneously with a new device that can work with Chromagnon as a companion, and offers a unique standalone feature set.  This is something we've had in development since the release of Scrolls, and it's something we've mentioned in the past, but we'll save any spoilers for later this Summer. In any case, it will be Chromagnon's co-pilot in helping initiate fulfillment. Our strategy involves these two products sharing similar production lines, so that sales of the new product will help us ship Chromagnons faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having been forced to make the above decisions, I am in a better position to be able to wrap up the Chromagnon core board project -- I'll write to you again when that job is done, and when I can show you a photo of the new enclosure piece, toward the end of May. I believe we have a clear path to launching Chromagnon fulfillment this Summer, and despite recent obstacles, this makes me very happy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been a highly productive past month here at LZX HQ, despite many ups and downs.  We've made a big progress push on Chromagnon with new PCB designs for subassemblies and their test boards, we've got PRM kits in stock, and we've published another round of content for our docs website.</p>
<p>The current political climate and new tariffs imposed on imports from China have us heavily concerned for everything we do here.  We received a tax bill in the past month that was several times higher than anything we've seen before. Those of you who have been following our company for a while know that we follow a market price methodology to pricing our products, which means that what you pay for them is a direct product of the hard costs involved in parts and labor -- in other words, if the cost of the parts go up, the price will need to go up at some point as well.  We aren't there yet, as we're hoping the situation will change.  If you've been looking at picking up some modules, it is a good time to get in before that happens.  We will honor all orders and backorders at the current pricing levels.</p>
<p>If you've been following along with Chromagnon, we've been pushing for over a year on a fully integrated single board solution designed to finalize the Chromagnon design so that it can enter production.  We've been stuck at a stasis point on the next revision of that board for a few month, as you all are holding the line without much news.  I've realized that the integrated single board approach has been holding us back from finalizing the design, and that the lost time in sealing the design is costing us more than time spent on alternative approaches -- such as the modular subassemblies we were working on earlier in the project.  We've decided to pick up that thread and make a move toward a new version of the subassemblies, and integrating them into the next revision of the core.  This will ensure that we cut no corners when it comes to precision and stability, even though it will raise our production costs and labor when it comes time for production.</p>
<p>I'm happy to say that this effort has been a great success -- we've designed, built and validated 5 different submodules and their test boards in the past month.  The test boards allow us to calibrate and test each submodule before installation on the main assembly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon-subassemblies-5be7a5db5b5c84b870d017bab5ec9b1c.jpg" width="1280" height="760" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Modular subassemblies</em></p>
<p>Pictured above you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>FQM-REVC, a quad multiplier submodule. This circuit is an enhanced derivative of the venerable MC1494 multiplier topology, optimized for video transmission and bandwidths.  It has individual trimming points for null, bias and gain.</li>
<li>DEC-REVA, a fully encapsulated decoder/encoder submodule designed to transform CVBS and Component video inputs into 1V RGB signals.</li>
<li>FWR-REVA, a quad rectifier submodule.  This circuit leverages the enhanced performance of our new P series rectifier, and will ensure that Chromagnon's shape generation functions do not produce distortions around the mirror thresholds of diamonds and other shapes.</li>
<li>FQA-REVA, a quad active attenuverter submodule.  This circuit is a revision of our classic null gap active video attenuverter design.</li>
<li>HGA-REVA, a quad high gain clipping amp submodule.  The test board is shown, but the assemblies are missing in this photo.  This design provides high gain amplification of an input signal, with the integrated limiting amplifier clipping the outputs.  It has a few uses, but soft key generation is the most obvious one.  This is a new revision of circuits from Doorway, Staircase/Stairs, and Topogram.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/fqm-revc-3cf26e5050747f35f192ed64fc7d1afe.jpg" width="1280" height="1001" class="img_ev3q">
<em>A closer look at FQM-REVC</em></p>
<p>The best part of these submodules testing well, is that we are much closer to done!! We have one more submodule design in progress, and then the next revision of the Chromagnon Core RevI can be completed -- with most of the circuitry moved to these submodules, the next Chromnagnon core board revision will go fast rather than being another tedious revision of a giant board.  I look forward to providing an update on that in the next update.</p>
<p>Our content designers have been plowing through the massive amounts of documentation required for our new docs website, and we've just published an update that includes baseline content for the remaining Gen3 modules without proper user manuals.  We'll be adding more illustrations and written content to this over time: <a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/module-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/module-list</a></p>
<p>After getting held up in customs, we finally have some kits in stock for our Precision Rectifier &amp; Multipler (PRM) module.  This module is a basic ingredient of video synth functions, and the number of functions you can patch with it is a long list.  Read about them on the docs website here: <a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/prm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/prm</a></p>
<p>Times are tough for the whole industry of USA based synth makers right now.  It is with undying gratitude that we thank you for helping us keep the dream alive here at LZX Industries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Hi video friends,]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi video friends,</p>
<p>I'm writing to provide you with the news about current and ongoing projects at LZX.</p>
<p>The current Chromagnon Core PCB RevI revision remains a work in progress. Following the release of this version, I expect to move into fulfillment plans and scheduling. I'm currently weighing a few options which will have a big impact on how that all goes, and playing catch up on projects delayed in January and February.  The pace at which progress can be made with Chromagnon is set by the health of our sales and the synth industry in general, and this year has started roughly in that regard.  Despite that, I remain confident that LZX and Chromagnon will pull through strongly.</p>
<p>After a year's hiatus, we released our first new module in November last year: PGO.  We now have five more in this series available, in what we are calling the P series: modules which fit one of the three themes: Passive, Precision or Programmable.  P Series functions are not complex, exciting video effects on an individual basis: they are the building blocks of them. Those of you who wish to dig into the nuts and bolts of analog graphics will find that all the right operators are here to patch most of the functions in our other modules.  As we consider revising earlier modules and developing  new modules, this series provides a chance to encapsulate our best practices in video synth module design thus far, and provide a solid foundation on which to do so.</p>

<p>PROGRAMMABLE</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings from Portland, video friends. January (and now most of February) have delivered some frustrating setbacks for both work and personal life.  We had our furnace in the home/workshop go out for 10 days in January, followed by me getting sick for a couple of weeks.  This kept me off the Chromagnon workbench, but I used the time to make more progress with the firmware.</p>
<p>Currently in the workshop we're scrambling to build the last few module restocks required to put a few Double Vision systems on the shelf.  If you want one, they will be available soon!</p>
<p>The Chromagnon Core RevH board has been reviewed, and I'm now making a few changes for RevI.  Since I'm aiming for this to be the production version, I'm being careful to review every line item on the BOM against current supply chain availability, and find alternates for a few components that are more costly than they need to be.</p>
<p>During my firmware sprint in January, I wrote a desktop app which communicates over USB with our hardware, allowing remote settings editing and monitoring.  This is a big feature boost for Chromagnon, as it means I can enable user control over many advanced settings that aren't accessible via the frontpanel or Chromagnon's rear 16-position DIP switch.  I have been integrating the communications library into other projects as well, and the plan is to release the desktop application as a general purpose utility for interacting with all of the LZX embedded hardware in greater detail.</p>
<p>Jonah and I have also been wrapping up the details on a few new modules that have been in development, and trying to "close all our open tabs" in this regard. Here's a list of modular projects we've finalizing.</p>
<p>Analog Computing Operators</p>
<ul>
<li>PGO, Programmable Gain &amp; Offset (4HP) - available now!</li>
<li>PRM, Precision Rectifier &amp; Multiplier (4HP)</li>
<li>PAB, Programmable Active Buffers (4HP)</li>
</ul>
<p>Passive Utilities</p>
<ul>
<li>MLT, Passive Multiples (8HP)</li>
<li>LNK, Passive Links (4HP)</li>
<li>P, Passive Potentiomter (2HP)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Projects</p>
<ul>
<li>New video encoder designs, including digital outputs</li>
<li>A slim new audio envelope/low frequency event generator module</li>
<li>Expedition Mk2 releases such as a new War of the Ants and Sensory Translator</li>
<li>EuroRack +/-12V power supply expanders for the Vessel 168/Vessel 84 cases.</li>
<li>The Vessel 208 case, which will feature a high quality latching lid for travel</li>
</ul>
<p>Also in the past few weeks I have been working with graphic designer Ramin Rahni, who has been developing illustrations for the Gen3 modules for our documentation website we launched with PGO back in October. I'd also like to shout out Gary MacLeod, a community member who has helped immensely with solving issues with our website -- which now loads much faster, and has better product galleries.  We have Aaron Ross, a beloved community member and instructional designer, lined up to help with content editing and development too.  I'm very grateful for the opportunity to work with these pros in a bartered exchange for modules -- as our budgets are quite slim going into Chromagnon season.</p>
<p>In parting, I received a note recently that expressed frustration over having not received an apology for the run-on-sentence that has been the Chromagon project timeline.  To be clear and quite frank: I am deeply sorry for the wait, and I take full and unequivocal responsibility for it. I feel the sorriness of it deep in my bones each night as I'm trying fall asleep.  I feel it deep in my gut every time I pause to think about the number of artists who made a purchase with their budget for creative equipment they do not yet have in their hands.  This project has been the exact opposite of the scenario I wanted with LZX, and the biggest project planning/timing blunder I've ever made in my life.  I also feel quite guilty I can't just lock myself in a room 24/7 until it's done -- the business has to be run, kids have to eat, rent has to be paid, so products still have to be developed alongside.  I'm continuously rotating through projects, and moving Chromagnon forward with as many resources as I can give it.  I'm really looking forward to delivering on the promise of this device, and ending this chapter in our shared story.  Despite it all, thank you for believing in the dream of Chromagnon. You have all been very understanding and I owe you my gratitude. I can't speak for all of you, but I know for some it will have been more than worth the wait.</p>
<p>Love and light, I look forward to writing again soon,</p>
<p>Lars</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year from us here at LZX! We are grateful for an opportunity to be part of your creative lives and wish you triumphant returns on all of your endeavors in 2025. It is our fifteenth year of offering tools to you, and our eighteenth year of developing analog video synthesizers. I feel very excited about our point of view on our existing and future projects at LZX, and 2025 should be fun year.</p>
<p>The requested Chromagnon recap:  2024 started off strong, with the launch of this production blog, and a new redesign of the Chromagnon Core assembly: RevF.  This assembly was designed to put all the remaining assembly work onto a single board, so that we could finally start shipping the project.  Our plans moved strongly thru the RevF review, but there were still several functional changes that needed to be made.  Then we got hit with the unexpected: sales slowed drastically this year, forcing us to downsize.</p>
<p>Moving into the Summer, we lost a few months of Chromagnon time scrambling to update processes and keep the business flowing.  By the end of the Summer, this task was done, and the second Chromagnon revision for the year was in review: RevG.  During the late Summer and into the Fall I wrote Chromagnon's firmware, as RevG was complete enough to write all the firmware functionality.  But there were still a few issues to resolve with the hardware, so in October I heavily into the RevH revisions.  With this revision, we also needed to integrate Chromagnon into our workflow outsourcing SMT assemblies.</p>
<p>The RevH order was sent in November, and review of the RevH prototype has been ongoing (and successful) since early December, with a couple of bumps in the road that required us to pick it up and put it back down a couple of times while waiting for parts. So, going well, but not going fast. The review is almost complete, and after it's done I'll make another blog post about what's next. We are close to our "ship unit one" milestone, which is when a complete hardware unit goes to a beta tester. That might be RevH, or it may be RevI -- not positive yet.</p>

<p>What else did we do in 2024?  We launched our new 6U case design, and our first packaged system: Double Vision.   We also released the utility module PGO, and we said goodbye to Vidiot, with a limited run of 24 units using our remaining stock of enclosures.</p>
<p>What else will we do in 2025?  We have a few new module designs nearing readiness we are excited to introduce.  We will also keep building and expanding on the documentation website, and providing some fresh content for existing modules.</p>
<p>What would you like to see from LZX this year? We'd love to hear all about your needs.</p>
<p>Talk again soon,
Lars</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Vidiots &amp; Vidiettes! We're happy to say we got the shipping notification for the Chromagnon Core PCB prototypes mentioned in the last blog today.  The next update will focus on that -- in this one I wanted to provide a few updates about projects we are working on to keep the company running as we get through the final milestones with Chromagnon.</p>
<p>The first is a new module, PGO, a 4HP Programmable Gain &amp; Offset processor, which is now available.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-modules-workbench-ffc0049e38aaaebd3fc85da024c04315.jpg" width="4080" height="3060" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-diy-kits-77ee5d7a6dfbfeeb3611c8fbaa32f312.jpg" width="3517" height="2717" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-module-box-056fb359ad03b859448bc27084b360be.jpg" width="3060" height="4080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This module is the first in a new series of modules titled P Series, which will focus on core utility modules that are available in both assembled and DIY forms.  We have also used PGO to prototype a more complete approach to our product documentation, and you can see what that looks like here at <a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/pgo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/pgo</a>.  P Series can be considered the successor to Cadet series, as well as Expedition modules providing raw functions, such as Bridge and Arch. We have a few more planned, and we'll release them over the upcoming months.</p>
<p>PGO may not appeal to every video synthesist -- it is a raw function, and is the kind of module you can use as a building block in patching more complex custom functions. For myself, I'm very excitd to have 16 of them in their own rack, and using that rack for future development ideas.  For existing Gen3 owners, you could use it this way -- or in a few other contexts as well.  Check out the docs linked above for more on that topic.</p>
<p>In other news, we have a few new variations for the Double Vision System available.  The first is the option to purchase Double Vision with our 168HP modular case, allowing 84HP of empty space to grow into.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/double-vision-system-6u-19adf8ece2e7f769b8fc333482a2fa52.png" width="1024" height="547" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The second is an expanded Double Vision system including 168HP of Gen3 modules.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/double-vision-system-168-4553df7d6780c63e56c97473bdafbd80.png" width="1024" height="547" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The third is an expander for existing Double Vision owners, allowing you to upgrade your existing Double Vision to the 168HP and 84HP of new modules.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/double-vision-expander-168-6da7f296e071e8e98c29dd819773a1ac.png" width="1024" height="547" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We have stock of these variants available now.</p>
<p>Let's answer your questions!</p>
<p><em>Van Ta asked, "Those 4Q multiplier submodules from the last entry look really exciting. Are you planning to sell them as well for DIYers?"</em></p>
<p>I'd like to!  I'm not sure what form that will take yet, in light of the P Series DIY modules, and our next development plans. The next P Series module is a programmable comparator, switch, and multiplier combo function. Since it is a 4HP module, I'm going with an IC based multiplier for the first prototype. The discrete cell designs are probably most practical in the context of a DIY rotator or matrix multiplier module. If I don't do something specific with the boards I developed, I will consider releasing the designs so others can dig in.</p>
<p><em>Asjave asked, "Does the Double Vision system have everything in the Chromagnon and more, or are there features in Chromagnon that don't exist in the Double-Vision system? Thank you!"</em></p>
<p>Double Vision and Chromagnon are entirely different video synthesizers, with different internal functions.  They are similar in that they can both process an SD/HD analog video signal, and perform various shape generation, pattern synthesis, feedback, and colorization effects.  But the specifics are quite different.  The biggest functional add for Double Vision is its open ended patchability and being able to mix and process two external video sources.  You could consider Chromagnon a <em>video processor</em>, and Double Vision a <em>video mixer.</em></p>
<p><em>Sig asked, "Any chance the new TBC2 VGA expander comes with an EDID chip? If not, would you consider this for a future version? I think it would be a really nice feature."</em></p>
<p>Hi Sig, no -- the VGA expander doesn't have an EDID chip, but that is an interesting proposal.  In its current architecture, TBC2 is designed to auto-detect the incoming video format and, if supported, lock to it. An EDID chip would allow the transmitting device to read the supported input formats and present those as valid options to the user.  Since you can see the supported TBC2 input formats in our documentation, you should be able to configure your device appropriately as it is -- but I can understand why the EDID chip would be a nice thing to have.</p>
<p><em>Pat said, "Hi! I just finished reading the latest monthly journal entry (November). It sounds like you guys are making some great progress but I'm a little confused with all the technical talk and where Chromagnon sits along the timeline of being finished. Would it be possible to include some type of metric in each post for the layman? Say, like a percentage of completion where 100% means the unit is ready to ship? I appreciate all the details but it's hard for me to figure out what it all means in the big picture."</em></p>
<p>I understand -- I appreciate that the jargon may be frustrating to read when you are looking for an answer to a simple question. At the beginning of the year on January 5th's blog, I outlined 3 milestones to completing this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production ready</li>
<li>Ship unit one</li>
<li>Ship all pre-orders</li>
</ul>
<p>Since there are so many moving pieces involved in the project, it would be difficult to quantify <em>percentage complete</em> in terms of the overall ongoing project.  For example, most of the production work is already done, since Chromagnon's control board assembly went into production back in 2021-2022. Going into this year, the "Production ready" milestone includes finalizing parts design, PCB design, and firmware.  Compared to where we were in January, parts design is 100% done, PCB design is <em>pending</em> 100% done, and firmware is 95% done.  We were at this state back in August too, but the most recent PCB design needed more work, and it took a few weeks to make that revision.  So in other words, <em>if</em> no more hardware revisions are neccessary on this incoming prototype -- we will be moving past the Production ready milestone finally, before the end of the year.  The leap from Production Ready to Ship Unit One is not so big, and much easier to estimate. It will happen right after production ready, as most of the tasks involved in prepping for that next milestone have already been completed.  I hope this helps you understand better where we are with the project.</p>
<p><em>Dan asked, "Do you think Chromagnon will be shipping by Christmas 2024?"</em></p>
<p>It is quite possible we will reach the Ship Unit One milestone (see above reply to Pat) before the end of the year. Sometime in December, after reviewing the next incoming PCB prototype, I will know for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello video fiends -- we hope everyone had a spooky Halloween!</p>
<p>Per my last missive at the beginning of October, I was focusing in on revisions to the Chromagnon Core RevH board.  The plan was to have those revisions complete and the board reviewed before the end of October, and I was developing multiple discrete submodules to aid in that task. I'm happy to say that the board is now ordered, but with a few weeks of hassle -- both in the revision process, and the coordination process with our external vendor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/fqm-submodule-revb-8b456477d575843a2bfb634326ec0231.png" width="1600" height="734" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>A discrete quad multiplier subassembly and testing jig</em></p>
<p>After racing between various solutions, I was able to settle on one that did not require submodules at all, in order to fit the full circuit onto the existing assembly -- which is a good thing, for Chromagnon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon-core-revh-render-b9c55c52bf466479bf4e1f335e9fedcb.png" width="1559" height="668" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Chromagnon Core RevH</em></p>
<p>The board's BOM is so big it was causing issues with the vendor's system initially -- thankfully they were able to resolve that, but it cost us over a week.  I wanted to hit this milestone before publishing a new blog.  It's nice to be writing this one knowing that assembly is underway, and that I'll be able to begin testing RevH immediately when it arrives in the latter half of November.</p>
<p>Despite being behind where I wanted to be at the end of October, this milestone is quite exciting.  With the off site assembly process flowing smoothly, we have the stage set for formal production when it is go time.   I look forward to writing another update about Chromagnon toward the end of the month.</p>
<p>In other news, in the time in between Chromagnon tasks, I have been working on our new documentation website at <a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.lzxindustries.net</a>.  You may be there already, as it is the new location for this blog.  Most of the content is hidden from public view for now, but I'm quite happy with how the illustration and writing process is going so far.  We'll be migrating most content from our current website to this new static site soon -- including all module documentation, resources and articles.</p>
<p>Finally, here's a teaser of a new module we have been working on. It will be available as a DIY project as well as assembled.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-rgb-a5e059f12aacc9ee3a0e94168db9212a.png" width="1600" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We'll tell you more about it and more about the docs site in the next update.  I have a little over a week before my Chromagnon board arrives, to make some progress in these areas.</p>
<p>Other news: more Double Vision systems are being built this month and are available to order now.  We have healthy stock of most Gen3 modules, if you're looking to pick up something new for your system this Fall.</p>
