            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lauren Klotzman is a multi-medium conceptualist who conducts an anti-disciplinary philosophy in their creative process. "Klotzman is an instrumentalist, operating an analog modular video synthesizer to create 'video paintings' via electricity." Klotzman views time and energy as one, composing life and therefore the art that flows through it.</p>

<p>Based in Texas, Klotzman grew up wanting to pursue animation. However, rather than the fluidity and non-linear nature of cartooning, they found themself more interested in complex shapes and angular designs. "My drawings were pretty firmly rooted in geometric abstraction," they'd admit. After being told by a professor that the art they wished to create was outside the scope of traditional animation courses, Lauren acknowledged that animation wasn't the avenue that accurately matched their creative vision.</p>

<p>Rather than describing it as a "creative process," Klotzman views the creation of their process as an intuitive conception of many energy forms given visual form. "That can be as literal as the electricity which courses through the system or as woo-woo as energies which are more easily described as being within the realm of the spiritual." Lauren doesn't go into creating a patch with a suspected outcome; they let art flow naturally. "Sometimes, I am not even looking at a video monitor while I am patching: it's more of a contemplative practice or a meditation than anything else," they admit. Simply put, they let the cables land where they want to and the patch becomes organically unique.</p>

<p>Klotzman is currently working on setting up a new studio space, which has halted the synthesis part of their creative toolshed for the time being. "I've taken time to work in older ways that have less to do with synthesis, but I am very excited to eventually finalize a new setup which will be conducive to creating works which are even longer and more complicated than what I have previously created," they're excited to mention. Lauren is looking forward to creating with both their older and newer tools, upcoming shows, and potential collaborations.</p>

<p>Starting with a drawing, capturing it with photography, then mutating an image to give it life through digital processing — "I analyze the data contained in an image: syntactically (pixel coordinates, chrominance, luminance, segmentation) and semantically (foreground, landscape, object, face, etc.). I then cut the image into parts, to which I give independent evolutionary properties depending on what I want to express," he explains.</p>

<p>Vincent was always interested in the construction of identity through visual arts. "One of the concepts that intrigued me was the evolution of points of view, the fact that they were in motion, that the concept of time gave depth and complexity to a perspective." This led him to the world of video — something always in motion, a representation of time. In his research, he worked with cognitive scientist Bilge Sayim to learn the complexities of the brain and how it reacts to stimuli. "By segmenting high and low luminance in a 2D image signal and using displacement, I recreate the parallax clue that the brain interprets as 3D. It's glitchy and difficult to control, but it works!" he admits. These concepts are the tools he uses to drive his visual creations.</p>

<p>Vincent Bergeron is currently working on visuals for three short films in collaboration with fellow artists:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>"Vorace"</strong> — in collaboration with sound artist Léopold Cordier, aims to illustrate the Canut revolt (one of the first worker revolts) in a memorial lens through a contemporary view of struggle through abstract memory.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>"dansLesSouts"</strong> — in collaboration with sound artist Samy Bérard, encourages escape from a capitalist world through 3D images and a spatialization system, giving it potential for a compelling live sensory experience.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>"ThePaleBlueDot"</strong> — in collaboration with sound artist "Gil.Barte," penetrates the control and safety of "home" by bringing the outside in via technology, thus contrasting the physical comfort of being somewhere safe with the endless stream of consciousness that is the internet and social media.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, we laid out our plans for finishing 2025 and getting into 2026. Here's how it all turned out.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="videomancer">Videomancer<a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/blog/year-end-update#videomancer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Videomancer" title="Direct link to Videomancer" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Videomancer is shipping now. Batches 1 and 2 (160 units total) have shipped, and Batch 3 (the final 80 units) is shipping over the next two weeks. Orders are currently closed but will reopen in January 2026 with new stock ready to ship.</p>
<p>Production and shipping have gone very well. We've partnered with a new contract assembly house that will help us keep up with demand going forward.</p>
<p>Firmware is in beta, with a major release planned for January that fixes bugs and adds new features and programs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Behind the scenes: Videomancer production" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/videomancer-pcbs-09c8f661e404529850b64f1765db76b8.jpg" width="3360" height="2620" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="chromagnon">Chromagnon<a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/blog/year-end-update#chromagnon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chromagnon" title="Direct link to Chromagnon" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Chromagnon progress stretched longer than expected in 2025, mainly because Videomancer's success kept me focused on production and shipping through October and November. Currently I'm wrapping up the next Videomancer firmware release, then transitioning to Chromagnon hardware revisions in January.</p>
<p>A realistic timeline for Chromagnon production is toward the end of Q1 2026. The good news: Videomancer's success means we have no barriers to completing Chromagnon and moving into production. We'll integrate Chromagnon assembly orders with our third-party contractor, using the same large-batch approach that worked well for Videomancer - batches of 80-120 units.</p>
<p>If you'd like to preview Chromagnon's functionality, check out the <a class="" href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/blog/chromagnon-simulator-downloads">Chromagnon Simulator downloads</a> we released earlier this month.</p>

<p>2025 started with a strong sprint on Chromagnon's analog design. Then tariffs and rising component costs threw a monkey wrench in our plans. Shelving exciting analog work to address the production crisis was disappointing, but necessary.</p>
<p>Videomancer turned out to be a fascinating project - hot-swappable FPGA firmware, lean and affordable FPGA video processing architecture, and our first open source releases with the <a href="https://github.com/lzxindustries/videomancer-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Videomancer SDK</a>.</p>
<p>2026 will be even more exciting. I plan to spend most of the year on Chromagnon and iterating Videomancer's codebase and programs. We may start work on Memory Palace 2 before year's end, and I'd like to squeeze in some new analog module designs that have been brewing.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking with us through all the twists and turns. See you in 2026.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/video_sync_01-3610ca17f164b0bb7ce102c83dd8a2d9.jpg" width="4284" height="5712" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>What's up next for LZX? This year has required some massive juggling of our priorities in response to the fluctuating new tariffs, which have effectively demolished our plans going into this year. We were hoping to be shipping Chromagnon by the end of the Summer, but have spent most of the past few months scrambling to figure out how we are going to continue making our products. We have been doing a lot of assessment and planning in August, and despite it all, we remain optimistic about the road ahead. Here is the top level plan as it currently stands.</p>
<p><em>Going into September,</em> we are finishing a large number of in house production projects, and will be caught up on backorders made over the Summer.</p>
<p><em>By the end of September,</em> our new multi-effects console, Videomancer, will be in production.  During this time we will be polishing the firmware release for Videomancer while also revising Chromagnon hardware to implement new circuits that were designed and validated for Videomancer.  This Chromagnon redesign is essential, as the new tariffs made our previously planned approach impossible.</p>
<p><em>By the end of October,</em> we will be shipping Videomancer units.  Sales will initially be limited to whatever we have been able to build or already have in production.  By your request, Chromagnon pre-order customers will be e-mailed a code to allow early access to purchases of Videomancer a few days before the public launch date.</p>
<p><em>In early November,</em> we will be validating and writing firmware for the revised Chromagnon hardware.  We plan to share a lot of media as we go through this phase.</p>
<p><em>By the end of December,</em> we expect to have the redesigned build of Chromagnon ready to go into assembly and fulfillment in 2026.</p>
<p><em>How fast will Chromagnon fulfillment happen?</em>  By the time we hit the hardware/firmware milestones mentioned above, we will be able to assess our position on this better.  But there are two ways we expect it could go.  If we are doing strongly after the sales season, we will build Chromagnon in large batches, outsourcing extra help, and hoping to ship all orders in 1-3 waves of shipments.  If that is not possible, we will be integrating Chromagnon into our existing production workflows and start making monthly shipments of a variable number of units dependent on our logistical constraints at the time. With the global economy in flux right now, we don't have a way to forecast this accurately.  This may be a year without many video synthesizers under the tree, just due to the general instability of the global market right now.</p>
<p>Here are a few images to share from Videomancer development.  This must be considered a behind-the-scenes slideshow, so please don't take anything you see here as a final answer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello eyeball friends -- I'm taking a break from an intense development sprint to say thank you for your support and patience over the past month, as we shift activities and processes in response to the tariffs on most of the parts we use in production.  We have the in house SMT machine running the past couple weeks and are making headway on your recent backorders.</p>
<p>I've alluded to a plan unfolding regarding Chromagnon and a new companion product that will launch alongside it this year, after some revisions which synergize the embedded digital systems used on both.  Our previous plan was <em>ship unit one and then work out the production details</em> and now it has become <em>ship the first 100 units alongside the first 100 units of the new product.</em>  If things go according to plan, this twin effort will bring the business back into good shape, after suffering some tumultuous years with Chromagnon's tardiness and the lack of our more popular standalone products in the catalog, like Vidiot and Memory Palace.  The shared embedded infrastructure is what I've been working on all Summer so far, on top of coordinating more production in house.</p>
<p>I've prepared a slideshow below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon_core-88301528483c771025106b65c8afddb8.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This is the Chromagnon Core, the board I've been working on since its major revision in early 2024.  With what you see here, the new analog submodules we discussed earlier this year, and the embedded system project -- we have all the pieces to the puzzle validated and optimized.  This board is getting changes integrated and the parts list is undergoing a detailed review.  The date at which this is all ready might be variable by several weeks, but becomes easier to estimate as I get closer.</p>
<p>We have been working for years on more modular embedded systems for FPGA video processing, and that's the focus of the companion product. which we have named Videomancer.  Here are some photos leading up to where we are with it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/tbc2x_prototype-a0aa7f11d62ed3105b5c299886c55951.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This was the first attempt after TBC2 at making the platform more modular, from around 2022 -- it runs the TBC2 firmware, but was never developed beyond that.  Instead we realized HDMI IO and availability as a standalone product would be necessary for this next step.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/analog_to_hdmi_test_platform-2126b029160e07eaabcf61a940a7c8f3.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This was our first test board for a minimal system designed to convert Analog signals to HDMI.  I did not get very far with it, but enough to lead into the next step.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/evs39_revb_prototype-c4c6df4d32e337f043eac7821080e163.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I couldn't find the first EVS39-REVA board to show you, but here is the second revision of it -- a standalone video processor with minimal IO.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/videomancer_prototype-34b918884ea7c6517c9827e061acfab1.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This led us to what is now production ready hardware for Videomancer in it's latest prototype.  After validating all of the circuits are working properly, the system on Videomancer's core board is being integrated on the Chromagnon core, replacing the previous Zynq SoC based platform.  This means both devices will be able to run off of a shared firmware infrastructure -- and all of that is looking beautiful.</p>
<p>As the Summer moves on, we'd love to hear more from you about your current and ongoing video art projects.  E-mail us or hang out with us in social media and let us know what you're working on!</p>
<p>Hopefully you can make it to <a href="https://videosync.xyz/portland2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Video Sync in Portland, OR on Aug 15th-17th</a>?  I will be giving a talk on my journey to developing the set of analog operators for video synthesis used in P-Series.</p>
<p>Love and light,
Lars</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A quick update as we wrap up May. Pricing revisions for all modules and modular systems go into effect tomorrow, June 1st.</p>
<p>Sheet metal parts for Chromagnon and its companion project are looking great! We're revising and preparing initial production orders.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/sheet_metal_prototypes-4f07f10a310114ee30562f659381ba1a.jpg" width="3358" height="2618" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The current focus is on software/hardware testing and revisions to the PCB assemblies.  We've been stuck here for a while, on Chromagnon, but are now making strides.  The outcome of this phase will be ordering the revised Chromagnon Core PCB, and the focus right now is on eliminating any variables that might compromise this next version's viability for immediate production.  That comes in the form of writing software driver tests for new parts we are using, further testing of the subassemblies we've developed, optimizing parts selections for cost and supply chain variance, PCB layout revisions, and so forth.</p>
<p>At some point tomorrow I'll update the webstore pricing -- if you place an order before then, the price you paid at checkout will be honored.</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your orders placed over the past two weeks, and the kind words of support as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello fellow gray hairs. I've aged 55-175 years since my last update.  There is a lot to discuss, and not all of it is bad.</p>
<p>The new tariffs on imports from China started hitting us full force around the time of my last update. For example, in the past with a small batch assembly order under $800 from one of our overseas vendors, we had not been charged any import tariffs.  This meant that outside of the occasional big delivery we could operate as a small business without the tariffs (imposed back in January) strangling us.</p>
<p>On April 23rd, logging in to place my usual purchases for PCB assemblies, I see that a tariffs line has been added at checkout for 175% of the order's value. My order was for $284.39 and the additional tariffs charge was $497.69!  This is nearly tripling our primary manufacturing expense. Most of the cost of an average LZX module is the PCB assembly and the video grade components mounted on it.</p>
<p>This change forced me to suspend multiple active production projects and temporarily disband the workshop team.  Since then I've been trying to do everything I can to figure out alternative strategies for LZX. Thankfully, there are plenty -- the most relevant of which is that we do have an in house SMT assembly machine. On May 14th the tariffs surcharge percentage dropped from 175% to 55% at our external vendor. This difference is enough for us to at least push forward, by only ordering the PCBs and doing all the assembly work here at LZX HQ.</p>
<p>We must assume that we'll be paying a 55% surcharge on any purchasing from China from now on (unless after this 90 day "pause" on tariffs they go up again). For LZX in the short term, the 55% tariff is going to apply directly to PCBs and SMT assembly stencils.  We're going to switch entirely back to in house SMT assembly, which means increased costs of assembly wages and inventory management (but not as much as paying tariffs on these items).  The effect of which is:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Effective June 1st, we will increase the pricing on all EuroRack modules and EuroRack modular systems by 20%.</li>
<li class="">There may be gaps of availability in some products this year as we pivot to new processes. We will be disabling backorders for any items temporarily going out of production after their next or current batches.</li>
<li class="">Pricing on Chromagnon, the Vessel case, cables, accessories, and power related products (like DC Distro) will remain the same.</li>
<li class="">You can purchase anything on our webstore at the current pricing until May 31st.</li>
<li class="">The shorter term cashflow really helps us right now, so please do not feel guilty for making purchases before the prices go up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amidst the scramble of the past month, I have continued to pursue my efforts to guide Chromagnon in for landing. Part of that is making some careful and informed decisions regarding the reality of manufacturing it smoothly, and how that will integrate into the evolving supply chain equation. Here is what that looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">We're not going to invest in injection mold tooling for Chromagnon's cases and molded parts, and will pursue alternative means of producing these pieces. This will cost a bit more in the long term, as we switch to more expensive processes and domestic vendors, but it will allow us to ease smoothly into fulfillment without hiccups and without sacrificing the quality of the end product.</li>
<li class="">The Chromagnon standalone enclosure will be upgraded from injection molded part to a single piece sheet metal design.  There will be a rear chicklet PCB that adapts the modular style power and sync connectors to the rear of the case.  Here's a look at it:
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon-sheet-metal-boat-preview-53aaa376f879ca7529c71ac23d359c02.png" width="2087" height="1422" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Rendering of sheet metal boat part for Chromagnon</em></li>
<li class="">From the launch date, there will be separate SKUs and prices for the module alone, or the module in its standalone enclosure.  Everyone with a current preorder gets the enclosure as expected.</li>
<li class="">We will use our existing Gen3 parts and suitable off the shelf options for control knobs, rather than custom molded parts, in order to guarantee proper fit and no production flow issues.</li>
<li class="">Custom button caps and the LED light grid will be combined into a single piece sprue that will be 3D printed by an industrial service in production quality resins. Check out the last posts about knobs early 2024 if you want to see what that looks like.</li>
<li class="">We won't be adding a cooling fan or a big rear panel. The architecture of the core board is changing away from a big integrated FPGA to testable submodules using FPGAs that are lower cost and don't require any cooling.  This means Chromagnon as a module will maintain the same mounting depth as other Gen3 modules.</li>
<li class="">We will be launching Chromagnon fulfillment simultaneously with a new device that can work with Chromagnon as a companion, and offers a unique standalone feature set.  This is something we've had in development since the release of Scrolls, and it's something we've mentioned in the past, but we'll save any spoilers for later this Summer. In any case, it will be Chromagnon's co-pilot in helping initiate fulfillment. Our strategy involves these two products sharing similar production lines, so that sales of the new product will help us ship Chromagnons faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having been forced to make the above decisions, I am in a better position to be able to wrap up the Chromagnon core board project -- I'll write to you again when that job is done, and when I can show you a photo of the new enclosure piece, toward the end of May. I believe we have a clear path to launching Chromagnon fulfillment this Summer, and despite recent obstacles, this makes me very happy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been a highly productive past month here at LZX HQ, despite many ups and downs.  We've made a big progress push on Chromagnon with new PCB designs for subassemblies and their test boards, we've got PRM kits in stock, and we've published another round of content for our docs website.</p>
<p>The current political climate and new tariffs imposed on imports from China have us heavily concerned for everything we do here.  We received a tax bill in the past month that was several times higher than anything we've seen before. Those of you who have been following our company for a while know that we follow a market price methodology to pricing our products, which means that what you pay for them is a direct product of the hard costs involved in parts and labor -- in other words, if the cost of the parts go up, the price will need to go up at some point as well.  We aren't there yet, as we're hoping the situation will change.  If you've been looking at picking up some modules, it is a good time to get in before that happens.  We will honor all orders and backorders at the current pricing levels.</p>
<p>If you've been following along with Chromagnon, we've been pushing for over a year on a fully integrated single board solution designed to finalize the Chromagnon design so that it can enter production.  We've been stuck at a stasis point on the next revision of that board for a few month, as you all are holding the line without much news.  I've realized that the integrated single board approach has been holding us back from finalizing the design, and that the lost time in sealing the design is costing us more than time spent on alternative approaches -- such as the modular subassemblies we were working on earlier in the project.  We've decided to pick up that thread and make a move toward a new version of the subassemblies, and integrating them into the next revision of the core.  This will ensure that we cut no corners when it comes to precision and stability, even though it will raise our production costs and labor when it comes time for production.</p>
<p>I'm happy to say that this effort has been a great success -- we've designed, built and validated 5 different submodules and their test boards in the past month.  The test boards allow us to calibrate and test each submodule before installation on the main assembly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon-subassemblies-5be7a5db5b5c84b870d017bab5ec9b1c.jpg" width="1280" height="760" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Modular subassemblies</em></p>
<p>Pictured above you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">FQM-REVC, a quad multiplier submodule. This circuit is an enhanced derivative of the venerable MC1494 multiplier topology, optimized for video transmission and bandwidths.  It has individual trimming points for null, bias and gain.</li>
<li class="">DEC-REVA, a fully encapsulated decoder/encoder submodule designed to transform CVBS and Component video inputs into 1V RGB signals.</li>
<li class="">FWR-REVA, a quad rectifier submodule.  This circuit leverages the enhanced performance of our new P series rectifier, and will ensure that Chromagnon's shape generation functions do not produce distortions around the mirror thresholds of diamonds and other shapes.</li>
<li class="">FQA-REVA, a quad active attenuverter submodule.  This circuit is a revision of our classic null gap active video attenuverter design.</li>
<li class="">HGA-REVA, a quad high gain clipping amp submodule.  The test board is shown, but the assemblies are missing in this photo.  This design provides high gain amplification of an input signal, with the integrated limiting amplifier clipping the outputs.  It has a few uses, but soft key generation is the most obvious one.  This is a new revision of circuits from Doorway, Staircase/Stairs, and Topogram.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/fqm-revc-3cf26e5050747f35f192ed64fc7d1afe.jpg" width="1280" height="1001" class="img_ev3q">
<em>A closer look at FQM-REVC</em></p>
<p>The best part of these submodules testing well, is that we are much closer to done!! We have one more submodule design in progress, and then the next revision of the Chromagnon Core RevI can be completed -- with most of the circuitry moved to these submodules, the next Chromnagnon core board revision will go fast rather than being another tedious revision of a giant board.  I look forward to providing an update on that in the next update.</p>
<p>Our content designers have been plowing through the massive amounts of documentation required for our new docs website, and we've just published an update that includes baseline content for the remaining Gen3 modules without proper user manuals.  We'll be adding more illustrations and written content to this over time: <a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/module-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/module-list</a></p>
<p>After getting held up in customs, we finally have some kits in stock for our Precision Rectifier &amp; Multipler (PRM) module.  This module is a basic ingredient of video synth functions, and the number of functions you can patch with it is a long list.  Read about them on the docs website here: <a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/prm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/prm</a></p>
<p>Times are tough for the whole industry of USA based synth makers right now.  It is with undying gratitude that we thank you for helping us keep the dream alive here at LZX Industries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi video friends,</p>
<p>I'm writing to provide you with the news about current and ongoing projects at LZX.</p>
<p>The current Chromagnon Core PCB RevI revision remains a work in progress. Following the release of this version, I expect to move into fulfillment plans and scheduling. I'm currently weighing a few options which will have a big impact on how that all goes, and playing catch up on projects delayed in January and February.  The pace at which progress can be made with Chromagnon is set by the health of our sales and the synth industry in general, and this year has started roughly in that regard.  Despite that, I remain confident that LZX and Chromagnon will pull through strongly.</p>
<p>After a year's hiatus, we released our first new module in November last year: PGO.  We now have five more in this series available, in what we are calling the P series: modules which fit one of the three themes: Passive, Precision or Programmable.  P Series functions are not complex, exciting video effects on an individual basis: they are the building blocks of them. Those of you who wish to dig into the nuts and bolts of analog graphics will find that all the right operators are here to patch most of the functions in our other modules.  As we consider revising earlier modules and developing  new modules, this series provides a chance to encapsulate our best practices in video synth module design thus far, and provide a solid foundation on which to do so.</p>

<p>PROGRAMMABLE</p>
<ul>
<li class="">PGO: 4HP Programmable Gain &amp; Offset</li>
<li class="">PAB: 4HP Programmable Active Buffers</li>
</ul>
<p>PRECISION</p>
<ul>
<li class="">PRM: 4HP Precision Rectifier &amp; Multiplier</li>
</ul>
<p>PASSIVE</p>
<ul>
<li class="">MLT: 8HP Passive Multiples</li>
<li class="">LNK: 4HP Passive Links</li>
<li class="">P: 2HP Passive Potentiometer</li>
</ul>
<p>All P Series modules are available in 3 variants:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Fully assembled, including any power cables</li>
<li class="">Full DIY kit, all parts included</li>
<li class="">Partial DIY kit, SMT assemblies and frontpanels only</li>
</ul>
<p>We have stock of all variants available now, except PRM -- we'll have those added to stock soon.  But you're welcome to place a backorder for that one. There has also been a price drop on the PGO partial DIY kit.</p>
<p>Other modules in development for 2025 include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">An RGB-to-HDMI encoder.</li>
<li class="">A system sync/waveform generator, with support for legacy connectors and some new tricks.</li>
<li class="">A sync distribution amplifier with front and rear connectors, for sync connections with external devices and expander cases.</li>
<li class="">An extended version of our first rotator module (Navigator) merged with features from our polar-to-cartesian module (Colorspace Mapper/Mapper).</li>
</ul>
<p>In parting, check out some new documentation work by our collaborators.  There are beautifully illustrated and animated docs now available for DSG3, Angles, Keychain and Proc.  There are also initial drafts up for the P Series modules. Check it out at <a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://docs.lzxindustries.net</a></p>
<p>We'll continue regularly adding to the docs throughout 2025.  Please let us know what you think of them.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Lars</p>]]></content:encoded>
