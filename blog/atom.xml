        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greetings from Portland, video friends. January (and now most of February) have delivered some frustrating setbacks for both work and personal life.  We had our furnace in the home/workshop go out for 10 days in January, followed by me getting sick for a couple of weeks.  This kept me off the Chromagnon workbench, but I used the time to make more progress with the firmware.</p>
<p>Currently in the workshop we're scrambling to build the last few module restocks required to put a few Double Vision systems on the shelf.  If you want one, they will be available soon!</p>
<p>The Chromagnon Core RevH board has been reviewed, and I'm now making a few changes for RevI.  Since I'm aiming for this to be the production version, I'm being careful to review every line item on the BOM against current supply chain availability, and find alternates for a few components that are more costly than they need to be.</p>
<p>During my firmware sprint in January, I wrote a desktop app which communicates over USB with our hardware, allowing remote settings editing and monitoring.  This is a big feature boost for Chromagnon, as it means I can enable user control over many advanced settings that aren't accessible via the frontpanel or Chromagnon's rear 16-position DIP switch.  I have been integrating the communications library into other projects as well, and the plan is to release the desktop application as a general purpose utility for interacting with all of the LZX embedded hardware in greater detail.</p>
<p>Jonah and I have also been wrapping up the details on a few new modules that have been in development, and trying to "close all our open tabs" in this regard. Here's a list of modular projects we've finalizing.</p>
<p>Analog Computing Operators</p>
<ul>
<li>PGO, Programmable Gain &amp; Offset (4HP) - available now!</li>
<li>PRM, Precision Rectifier &amp; Multiplier (4HP)</li>
<li>PAB, Programmable Active Buffers (4HP)</li>
</ul>
<p>Passive Utilities</p>
<ul>
<li>MLT, Passive Multiples (8HP)</li>
<li>LNK, Passive Links (4HP)</li>
<li>P, Passive Potentiomter (2HP)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Projects</p>
<ul>
<li>New video encoder designs, including digital outputs</li>
<li>A slim new audio envelope/low frequency event generator module</li>
<li>Expedition Mk2 releases such as a new War of the Ants and Sensory Translator</li>
<li>EuroRack +/-12V power supply expanders for the Vessel 168/Vessel 84 cases.</li>
<li>The Vessel 208 case, which will feature a high quality latching lid for travel</li>
</ul>
<p>Also in the past few weeks I have been working with graphic designer Ramin Rahni, who has been developing illustrations for the Gen3 modules for our documentation website we launched with PGO back in October. I'd also like to shout out Gary MacLeod, a community member who has helped immensely with solving issues with our website -- which now loads much faster, and has better product galleries.  We have Aaron Ross, a beloved community member and instructional designer, lined up to help with content editing and development too.  I'm very grateful for the opportunity to work with these pros in a bartered exchange for modules -- as our budgets are quite slim going into Chromagnon season.</p>
<p>In parting, I received a note recently that expressed frustration over having not received an apology for the run-on-sentence that has been the Chromagon project timeline.  To be clear and quite frank: I am deeply sorry for the wait, and I take full and unequivocal responsibility for it. I feel the sorriness of it deep in my bones each night as I'm trying fall asleep.  I feel it deep in my gut every time I pause to think about the number of artists who made a purchase with their budget for creative equipment they do not yet have in their hands.  This project has been the exact opposite of the scenario I wanted with LZX, and the biggest project planning/timing blunder I've ever made in my life.  I also feel quite guilty I can't just lock myself in a room 24/7 until it's done -- the business has to be run, kids have to eat, rent has to be paid, so products still have to be developed alongside.  I'm continuously rotating through projects, and moving Chromagnon forward with as many resources as I can give it.  I'm really looking forward to delivering on the promise of this device, and ending this chapter in our shared story.  Despite it all, thank you for believing in the dream of Chromagnon. You have all been very understanding and I owe you my gratitude. I can't speak for all of you, but I know for some it will have been more than worth the wait.</p>
<p>Love and light, I look forward to writing again soon,</p>
<p>Lars</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year from us here at LZX! We are grateful for an opportunity to be part of your creative lives and wish you triumphant returns on all of your endeavors in 2025. It is our fifteenth year of offering tools to you, and our eighteenth year of developing analog video synthesizers. I feel very excited about our point of view on our existing and future projects at LZX, and 2025 should be fun year.</p>
<p>The requested Chromagnon recap:  2024 started off strong, with the launch of this production blog, and a new redesign of the Chromagnon Core assembly: RevF.  This assembly was designed to put all the remaining assembly work onto a single board, so that we could finally start shipping the project.  Our plans moved strongly thru the RevF review, but there were still several functional changes that needed to be made.  Then we got hit with the unexpected: sales slowed drastically this year, forcing us to downsize.</p>
<p>Moving into the Summer, we lost a few months of Chromagnon time scrambling to update processes and keep the business flowing.  By the end of the Summer, this task was done, and the second Chromagnon revision for the year was in review: RevG.  During the late Summer and into the Fall I wrote Chromagnon's firmware, as RevG was complete enough to write all the firmware functionality.  But there were still a few issues to resolve with the hardware, so in October I heavily into the RevH revisions.  With this revision, we also needed to integrate Chromagnon into our workflow outsourcing SMT assemblies.</p>
<p>The RevH order was sent in November, and review of the RevH prototype has been ongoing (and successful) since early December, with a couple of bumps in the road that required us to pick it up and put it back down a couple of times while waiting for parts. So, going well, but not going fast. The review is almost complete, and after it's done I'll make another blog post about what's next. We are close to our "ship unit one" milestone, which is when a complete hardware unit goes to a beta tester. That might be RevH, or it may be RevI -- not positive yet.</p>

<p>What else did we do in 2024?  We launched our new 6U case design, and our first packaged system: Double Vision.   We also released the utility module PGO, and we said goodbye to Vidiot, with a limited run of 24 units using our remaining stock of enclosures.</p>
<p>What else will we do in 2025?  We have a few new module designs nearing readiness we are excited to introduce.  We will also keep building and expanding on the documentation website, and providing some fresh content for existing modules.</p>
<p>What would you like to see from LZX this year? We'd love to hear all about your needs.</p>
<p>Talk again soon,
Lars</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi Vidiots &amp; Vidiettes! We're happy to say we got the shipping notification for the Chromagnon Core PCB prototypes mentioned in the last blog today.  The next update will focus on that -- in this one I wanted to provide a few updates about projects we are working on to keep the company running as we get through the final milestones with Chromagnon.</p>
<p>The first is a new module, PGO, a 4HP Programmable Gain &amp; Offset processor, which is now available.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-modules-workbench-ffc0049e38aaaebd3fc85da024c04315.jpg" width="4080" height="3060" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-diy-kits-77ee5d7a6dfbfeeb3611c8fbaa32f312.jpg" width="3517" height="2717" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-module-box-056fb359ad03b859448bc27084b360be.jpg" width="3060" height="4080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This module is the first in a new series of modules titled P Series, which will focus on core utility modules that are available in both assembled and DIY forms.  We have also used PGO to prototype a more complete approach to our product documentation, and you can see what that looks like here at <a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/pgo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/pgo</a>.  P Series can be considered the successor to Cadet series, as well as Expedition modules providing raw functions, such as Bridge and Arch. We have a few more planned, and we'll release them over the upcoming months.</p>
<p>PGO may not appeal to every video synthesist -- it is a raw function, and is the kind of module you can use as a building block in patching more complex custom functions. For myself, I'm very excitd to have 16 of them in their own rack, and using that rack for future development ideas.  For existing Gen3 owners, you could use it this way -- or in a few other contexts as well.  Check out the docs linked above for more on that topic.</p>
<p>In other news, we have a few new variations for the Double Vision System available.  The first is the option to purchase Double Vision with our 168HP modular case, allowing 84HP of empty space to grow into.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/double-vision-system-6u-19adf8ece2e7f769b8fc333482a2fa52.png" width="1024" height="547" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The second is an expanded Double Vision system including 168HP of Gen3 modules.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/double-vision-system-168-4553df7d6780c63e56c97473bdafbd80.png" width="1024" height="547" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The third is an expander for existing Double Vision owners, allowing you to upgrade your existing Double Vision to the 168HP and 84HP of new modules.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/double-vision-expander-168-6da7f296e071e8e98c29dd819773a1ac.png" width="1024" height="547" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We have stock of these variants available now.</p>
<p>Let's answer your questions!</p>
<p><em>Van Ta asked, "Those 4Q multiplier submodules from the last entry look really exciting. Are you planning to sell them as well for DIYers?"</em></p>
<p>I'd like to!  I'm not sure what form that will take yet, in light of the P Series DIY modules, and our next development plans. The next P Series module is a programmable comparator, switch, and multiplier combo function. Since it is a 4HP module, I'm going with an IC based multiplier for the first prototype. The discrete cell designs are probably most practical in the context of a DIY rotator or matrix multiplier module. If I don't do something specific with the boards I developed, I will consider releasing the designs so others can dig in.</p>
<p><em>Asjave asked, "Does the Double Vision system have everything in the Chromagnon and more, or are there features in Chromagnon that don't exist in the Double-Vision system? Thank you!"</em></p>
<p>Double Vision and Chromagnon are entirely different video synthesizers, with different internal functions.  They are similar in that they can both process an SD/HD analog video signal, and perform various shape generation, pattern synthesis, feedback, and colorization effects.  But the specifics are quite different.  The biggest functional add for Double Vision is its open ended patchability and being able to mix and process two external video sources.  You could consider Chromagnon a <em>video processor</em>, and Double Vision a <em>video mixer.</em></p>
<p><em>Sig asked, "Any chance the new TBC2 VGA expander comes with an EDID chip? If not, would you consider this for a future version? I think it would be a really nice feature."</em></p>
<p>Hi Sig, no -- the VGA expander doesn't have an EDID chip, but that is an interesting proposal.  In its current architecture, TBC2 is designed to auto-detect the incoming video format and, if supported, lock to it. An EDID chip would allow the transmitting device to read the supported input formats and present those as valid options to the user.  Since you can see the supported TBC2 input formats in our documentation, you should be able to configure your device appropriately as it is -- but I can understand why the EDID chip would be a nice thing to have.</p>
<p><em>Pat said, "Hi! I just finished reading the latest monthly journal entry (November). It sounds like you guys are making some great progress but I'm a little confused with all the technical talk and where Chromagnon sits along the timeline of being finished. Would it be possible to include some type of metric in each post for the layman? Say, like a percentage of completion where 100% means the unit is ready to ship? I appreciate all the details but it's hard for me to figure out what it all means in the big picture."</em></p>
<p>I understand -- I appreciate that the jargon may be frustrating to read when you are looking for an answer to a simple question. At the beginning of the year on January 5th's blog, I outlined 3 milestones to completing this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production ready</li>
<li>Ship unit one</li>
<li>Ship all pre-orders</li>
</ul>
<p>Since there are so many moving pieces involved in the project, it would be difficult to quantify <em>percentage complete</em> in terms of the overall ongoing project.  For example, most of the production work is already done, since Chromagnon's control board assembly went into production back in 2021-2022. Going into this year, the "Production ready" milestone includes finalizing parts design, PCB design, and firmware.  Compared to where we were in January, parts design is 100% done, PCB design is <em>pending</em> 100% done, and firmware is 95% done.  We were at this state back in August too, but the most recent PCB design needed more work, and it took a few weeks to make that revision.  So in other words, <em>if</em> no more hardware revisions are neccessary on this incoming prototype -- we will be moving past the Production ready milestone finally, before the end of the year.  The leap from Production Ready to Ship Unit One is not so big, and much easier to estimate. It will happen right after production ready, as most of the tasks involved in prepping for that next milestone have already been completed.  I hope this helps you understand better where we are with the project.</p>
<p><em>Dan asked, "Do you think Chromagnon will be shipping by Christmas 2024?"</em></p>
<p>It is quite possible we will reach the Ship Unit One milestone (see above reply to Pat) before the end of the year. Sometime in December, after reviewing the next incoming PCB prototype, I will know for sure.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello video fiends -- we hope everyone had a spooky Halloween!</p>
<p>Per my last missive at the beginning of October, I was focusing in on revisions to the Chromagnon Core RevH board.  The plan was to have those revisions complete and the board reviewed before the end of October, and I was developing multiple discrete submodules to aid in that task. I'm happy to say that the board is now ordered, but with a few weeks of hassle -- both in the revision process, and the coordination process with our external vendor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/fqm-submodule-revb-8b456477d575843a2bfb634326ec0231.png" width="1600" height="734" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>A discrete quad multiplier subassembly and testing jig</em></p>
<p>After racing between various solutions, I was able to settle on one that did not require submodules at all, in order to fit the full circuit onto the existing assembly -- which is a good thing, for Chromagnon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon-core-revh-render-b9c55c52bf466479bf4e1f335e9fedcb.png" width="1559" height="668" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Chromagnon Core RevH</em></p>
<p>The board's BOM is so big it was causing issues with the vendor's system initially -- thankfully they were able to resolve that, but it cost us over a week.  I wanted to hit this milestone before publishing a new blog.  It's nice to be writing this one knowing that assembly is underway, and that I'll be able to begin testing RevH immediately when it arrives in the latter half of November.</p>
<p>Despite being behind where I wanted to be at the end of October, this milestone is quite exciting.  With the off site assembly process flowing smoothly, we have the stage set for formal production when it is go time.   I look forward to writing another update about Chromagnon toward the end of the month.</p>
<p>In other news, in the time in between Chromagnon tasks, I have been working on our new documentation website at <a href="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.lzxindustries.net</a>.  You may be there already, as it is the new location for this blog.  Most of the content is hidden from public view for now, but I'm quite happy with how the illustration and writing process is going so far.  We'll be migrating most content from our current website to this new static site soon -- including all module documentation, resources and articles.</p>
<p>Finally, here's a teaser of a new module we have been working on. It will be available as a DIY project as well as assembled.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/pgo-rgb-a5e059f12aacc9ee3a0e94168db9212a.png" width="1600" height="1200" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We'll tell you more about it and more about the docs site in the next update.  I have a little over a week before my Chromagnon board arrives, to make some progress in these areas.</p>
<p>Other news: more Double Vision systems are being built this month and are available to order now.  We have healthy stock of most Gen3 modules, if you're looking to pick up something new for your system this Fall.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>September flew right past us here at LZX, with steady (if tedious) progress toward Chromagnon production on my end, and multiple longer term production projects wrapping up in the workshop.</p>
<p>During spring cleaning earlier this year, we uncovered our remaining stock of Vidiot specific production parts, such as enclosures and side panels.  Rather than sending them to the junk, we've been making progress over the Sumer on building up a limited batch of 24 units using those parts.  You can order one now at <a href="https://lzxindustries.net/products/vidiot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://lzxindustries.net/products/vidiot</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/vidiot-f78c26636acedb582e5250d1d2d970a8.png" width="480" height="270" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We've made some revisions to our Double Vision system bundle -- including a full 3U EuroRack enclosure using our new sync and power distribution board architecture.  This version also includes the TBC2 expander, in lieu a DC Distro.  We have a couple systems in stock right now for purchse: at <a href="https://lzxindustries.net/products/double-vision-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://lzxindustries.net/products/double-vision-system</a></p>

<p>On the Chromagnon front, I have been laser focused (pun intended) on preparing the hardware for production.  After this last prototype review, the full context is a lot easier to see, including the remaining steps needed until we're actually placing the order for production core boards and molded parts. This process has been grueling, as the core board's BOM and parts count are massive. Thus, I've been breaking some repetitive parts of the analog circuit into submodules.</p>
<p>The first of those submodules is a four quadrant multiplier sub-assembly that encapsulates our discrete design. This design is based on topologies in classic multiplier ICs such as MC1494 and MC1495, which are long obsolete.  A core requirement of the Chromagnon design is the implementation of this discrete multiplier, as there are over 20 of them in its analog circuit!  We've been working on this circuit since before Chromagnon was even conceived, and after so many revisions I'm very pleased with how it is performing.  Here's a look at the submodule.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/submodule-5044199d99470952d22aa4fe9987c5c1.png" width="480" height="265" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This submodule is being reintegrated into Chromagnon's core board, which reduces the BOM count by a few hundred parts and will allow pre-testing/calibration of the analog circuit. We have already received our initial order of these submodules and are testing them now.</p>
<p>Revisions to Chromagnon Core RevH will be ordered by the end of this week.  I'm not used to spending entire weeks on a single PCB layout, so that gives you an idea of the scale of the effort required to push this forward. This is the first version of the board that is being 100% assembled out of our workshop, which means we're priming it to be ready to go, and it is a candidate for production.  I'd love to have it all confirmed and initial quantities ordered by the end of October -- there's not a lot left to stand in our way of that happening.</p>
<p>And now, here are answers to the questions you have submitted since the last update:</p>
<p><strong>Marty asked, "Looking forward to shipping on Chromagnon. Well done on all the work so far. When shipping does occur. Will the cost of the unit, detailed for customs. Reflect the date of purchase or current value? I'm just worried about the extra tax I'm going to pay when it ships to Australia."</strong></p>
<p>Hi, Marty. The customs info will reflect the price you paid on your original sales invoice.</p>
<p><strong>Pat asked, "Can we expect Chromagnon unit #1 to ship out by Halloween?"</strong></p>
<p>Probably not, Pat!  In the next Chromagnon milestone, I'm hoping to be telling you we've got RevH confirmed and have ordered initial production parts. That is getting very close, and would mean we have unit #1 here. Whether or not it's shipping by that date, I don't know -- firmware is about 95% done, but there's still a few items to wrap up and test once the hardware is sealed.</p>
<p><strong>Paul asked, "Would it be possible to demonstrate through your LZX documentation learning program, the placement and attachment of modules into a Vessel or eurorack case? And if any modules have to be linked together or sync. This is for those who don’t know. Thank you."</strong></p>
<p>Hi Paul. Yes, certainly! We do have a basic guide to doing this on our website at <a href="https://lzxindustries.net/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://lzxindustries.net/getting-started</a>. However, I'd love to expand on that and have some videos and better photos to go along with it.</p>
<p>Until next time,
Lars</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I hope everyone has enjoyed their Summers and is looking forward to the Fall.  For me, this time of year has always meant getting ready to learn, whether that was in my prior career in e-learning development, with my kids starting the next grade, or in my own educational goals. This year it will mean entering a period of content creation for LZX-- documentation, videos, tutorials, and any other resources that serve your own learning and creative pursuits in making video art.</p>
<p>Last week we reached a couple of big Chromagnon milestones: The RevG Core hardware has been fully reviewed; slow scan raster generation for ILDA laser and low-bandwidth displays has been implemented; and we have a complete synthesizer on the workbench -- finally!  Unlike software based visual generators, or simpler analog circuits (like our modules), Chromagnon is a design that has been very difficult to show as a work in progress until all of the pieces, both hardware and firmware, were in play.  I am very glad to be at this point, because you'll no longer have to take my word for it when it comes to what, how, and why Chromagnon does what it does.</p>

<p>Testing in progress.  Excuse the clutter!</p>
<p>I'll be recording more in September, including a walk through of Chromagnon's user interface and functions, as we continue checking off items on our test list and working towards finalization of the design for production.</p>
<p>Since our last update, we have one new user question.</p>
<p>** Pete said "Hi, Lars! Glad to hear your progress update, it must feel pretty good to get out of the cave and into the light!  I'm curious as to what h/w you have chosen for the Chromagnon. I'm interested in FPGAs and have ordered a Zybo board to experiment with." **</p>
<p>Pete, thanks for writing!  Chromagnon's hardware is quite intensive.  At it's core, it is an analog synthesizer with a fully analog, wideband signal path -- but also, there is a complex digital embedded system which handles the user interface, video input decoding and scaling (SD to HD and HD to SD), and 10-bit ramp waveform generation.</p>
<p>For the digital system, we are using a System-on-Module from MYiR, which you can read more about here. This is based on the Xilinx Zynq system on chip -- the same as employed on your Zybo board.  Xilinx FPGAs are used heavily in broadcast and imaging applications of all kinds. On our host board, we use video encoding and decoding interface ICs such as the ADV7181C, ADV7123 and ADV7125 for interfacing analog video with the Zynq IO ports. I hope you have fun with the Zybo board!</p>
<p>Talk to you again soon,
Lars</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past several weeks I have been writing Chromagnon’s firmware, and I’m happy to say that I now have a complete version ready for testing.  I wanted to reach this milestone before I wrote a new blog, as it represents my exit from the Code Cave and back into the workshop.  So let my eyeballs readjust – this blog will mostly be about the software.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromagnon-e23b2c0c52bf78d09f10230b703a5f9a.png" width="480" height="400" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>My trusty Chromagnon RevG development unit, back at the test bench</em></p>
<p>From Memory Palace and TBC2 to Chromagnon, I have needed to double down on my embedded software skills. Approaching these instruments, I had many firmware and software projects behind me – but none at this level of structural complexity.  So I was surprised by the scale of what I still needed to learn with regards to architectural patterns and systems level design. Hardware scales easily – five circuits is five circuits – but in software, writing a state control system for five asynchronous modules is a different beast entirely.  The experience has definitely kindled a love for embedded development with modern C++ in general, and I look forward to doing more of it. During the past few weeks of getting cozy with Chromagnon’s digital brain, I felt both confident and effective, and that was a relief.</p>
<p>What’s next? With firmware in place, we are able to move into a new verification process for the instrument as a whole.  That’s a long list of tests, including nearly 200 different video input conversion modes – in addition to all combinations of Chromagnon’s 12 compositor modes, 3 chroma modes, 3 luma modes, and 4 primary modes. Most of this testing has already been done with prior versions of the hardware, but we still need to repeat the tests now that we have a firmware candidate. In the next blog, I’ll describe how that’s going.</p>
<p>In other news, we have added the DIY kit version of our power &amp; sync distribution busboard to the webstore.  Check that out here.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/sync-c1b31073f87827f1f18cfd06304d2d49.png" width="480" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We also have a restock of Scrolls hitting the shelf. While I have not had time to film it yet, here is a script for a video about Scrolls that you may read.</p>
<p>Our Summer sale is active, with discounts offered on Sum/Dist, Contour and Matte modules.</p>
<p>We're still taking orders for Double Vision systems. It has been exciting to watch new video artists dig into the depths of their systems over the Summer.</p>
<p>Here are your questions, since the last post.</p>
<p><strong>Luis asked, "Are there any plans to further improve the Memory Palace firmware?"</strong></p>
<p>Memory Palace Mk2 will be a follow-up project after Chromagnon. The first phase of that project will include some revisions to the existing Mk1 firmware, as our plan is to support concurrent versions. The main difference being that Mk2 will support HD modes.</p>
<p><strong>Mat asked, "Just curious about the timeframe in regards to the Double Vision preorder. Will there be a long wait? I just ordered recently and will hopefully not have to wait as long as I have for the Chromagnon."</strong></p>
<p>Since we launched the Double Vision system bundle, the average wait time for a shipment has been about 3 weeks.  I expect that to stay consistent.  We have a good flow coming thru the workshop of stocking the module sets in small batches. Your Double Vision is actually in QC today, and planning to ship tomorrow.  You sent in this question on July 15th, so that seems pretty consistent with the average lead time.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas asked, "Are preorders for the Chromagnon still open? Nothing happens when I press the preorder button, and I see people selling their preorder slots online.  Am I too late to buy one?"</strong></p>
<p>Preorders are open. If you click the preorder button on the product page, you should see it added to your shopping cart (but the site doesn't automatically take you there.)  This is not a limited edition -- the date we have Chromagnons in stock and all preorders are fulfilled is still uncertain, but you don't need to worry about missing out.  We hope to keep the instrument in production for many years.</p>
<p><strong>Patrick said, "It seems like a lot is happening over there right now, and there are many updates and things to discuss in each monthly journal post. Is there any inclination to get back to doing a weekly journal post to keep us more in the loop? Or would that slow production down because it's another thing to think about? Either way, I'm glad Chromagnon is still being worked on. Since June has come and gone, is there any new estimate for when the first unit might ship out?"</strong></p>
<p>Patrick, I'm sorry the updates have been less frequent.  Currently the core team is down to myself full time and three part timers.  Writing these blog posts is no huge burden, but it does take 2-3 hours out of my work week each time. With hardware development and workshop projects, tasks are shorter -- 1 to 16 hrs each -- to do a board layout, or revision, or build a prototype.  With software or circuit design it's often 3-6 week sprints, during which it can be difficult for me to do anything but write code or run simulations.  With code sprints in the rear window for now, I'll try to up the pace of the updates.  I'm hoping to be past hardware verification and on to production and user docs soon.</p>
<p><strong>Kazys asked, "How effective is Chromagnon with a Vectrex? Can it do Rutt-Etra style rescanning into X / Y / Z out of the box?"</strong></p>
<p>We have not recorded any Vectrex monitor tests yet, and that should be the final judge of this -- but you've got the right idea. The scaler decimation settings allow you to output low frequency rasters for lower bandwidth displays, like laser projectors and the Vectrex. I expect some of the middle settings to be right for use with the Vectrex -- a raster size of 120x68, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Kazys also asked, "If I have a Chromagnon, why would I need an ESG3? Is it still useful?"</strong></p>
<p>Definitely. Chromagnon has no dedicated RGB level or offset controls, so ESG3 would add a lot, with each of ESG3's six knobs and three switches representing parameters not present on Chromagnon.  Another reason to have an ESG3 is if you are using Chromagnon in the context of a modular system, and want to mix it's output with other sources before the final output.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear video friends,]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear video friends,</p>
<p>June has seen a lot of projects landing at the workshop and some significant pushes in firmware development. Over the Spring we have transitioned into outsourcing SMT assembly of our modules in smaller batches, in an effort to keep things stocked and flowing, and those efforts are running smoothly.</p>
<p>The Summer is traditionally a period of low sales for us, so we have decided to open a sale for some modules we have lots of stock of. You will find Contour, Matte, and Sum/Dist have been marked down 25%, for the time being, on our webstore. If you've been wanting to pick one of these up, now is a good time to do so.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of notable recent milestones:</p>
<p>TBC2 1.0.3 firmware was released.  This includes better support for the VGA input expander and the addition of a 240p input mode.  So pull out your SNES and Chrono Trigger cartridge if you want to travel thru time, saving the world from Lavos, while also traveling thru your analog video circuits.</p>
<p>If you had an outstanding order for the TBC2 VGA input expander module, it has been shipped.</p>
<p>We are now stocking fan upgrade kits for TBC2 Mk1 &amp; Mk2 on our webstore.  If you already ordered the Mk1 (Orion style) kits from us, we neglected to send mounting screws in the first few shipments -- but the screws have already been mailed to you in a separate package this week.  So look out for that.</p>
<p>Memory Palace 2.0.2 firmware was released.  This is a maintenance release which includes a screensaver function to prevent burn-in on your OLED screen in the case that you are logging lots of hours on your device.</p>
<p>TBC2's video engine firmware has been ported to Chromagnon and is running on the new RevG PCB assembly.  I've put a lot of time into merging work from TBC2 into a common library that is now shared with Chromagnon, to ensure consistent performance across both devices.  This will also set the stage for Memory Palace Mk2 revisions, which will be the big project after Chromagnon development has wrapped.</p>
<p>This past week I have written a parameter state engine, with auto recovery from loss of power or corrupted backups, to use across our firmware for various modules.  This will ensure that Chromagnon boots back up in the same state in which it was powered down. We'll be able to integrate that functionality into the next firmware release for TBC2 as well.</p>
<p>Entering July, I am still investing most of my time into Chromagnon firmware and hardware review.  This includes writing tests for validating the control assemblies we've already built and the RevG hardware.  Currently I am improving the software that allows for firmware update from MicroSD card, since with Chromagnon it needs to run in a headless manner. (Unlike TBC2 and Memory Palace, which both used OLED screens and keypads.)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/thermal-camera-d44ea4d7f072ebf343c1cb51a0c9322b.png" width="480" height="360" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Chromagnon RevG under the thermal camera!</em></p>
<p>A few background projects landed in June as well, including some parts we will use to revise the Cadet DIY series.  This maintenance revision will be ongoing for a few months, and will bring the core DIY modules up to spec for HD video synthesis timing, and offer some new supply chain/build options for hard to source components.  Once these revisions are complete, we'll offer the PCB and frontpanel sets again via our webstore.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/thonk-cadets-51bd12756080fdf0ea98f98925c9063a.png" width="480" height="360" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Our order from Thonk for parts to use in building Cadet revisions.</p>
<p>In our ongoing initiative to offer a line of professional enclosures for our modules, the pieces for a 3U variant of our 6U rackmount case have arrived.  These will be an upgrade option for your Double Vision system, and we'll soon offer a version of the Double Vision system which uses this case.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/case-3u-1c9404300d162ca25a11b4a45e35d153.png" width="480" height="360" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>3U variant of our powered EuroRack case for video synthesizers</p>
<p>Additionally, a kit variant of our 10 amp DC power and sync distribution bus has arrived, for DIY installations into other cases. This version includes a chassis-mounted DC input jack and screw terminals on the PCB.  The busboard is equivalent to three times the amount of power and number of connectors as our 4HP DC distro module, and it will be suitable for powering cases of Gen3 modules over 252HP.   Look for this on our webstore in July.</p>
<p>Next case projects will include a portable variant with a lid, and a legacy power supply expander for the 6U and portable cases.  The legacy power supply expander will be perfect for powering audio modules or older generations of LZX modules using the new Vessel cases.  I'm excited to have a case that works with everything.</p>
<p><strong>Pat asked "The prototypes for the plastic pieces and enclosure look great! I’m stoked that you guys have come this far with the project!. A few weeks ago you said you are hoping to ship unit one in June, is that still the plan?"</strong></p>
<p>Hi, Pat. Thanks!! We are getting close to that point. The Summer slump I mentioned slowed us down slightly -- and I squeezed in the TBC2 and Memory Palace updates that folks have been waiting on for a while, which delayed us as well. With the firmware project above wrapped up, we will be close to shipping the first unit.  Then we can roll up our sleeves and get our headspace shifted into rolling into a rhythm with the remaining Chromagnon production, documentation, and fulfillment.</p>
<p><strong>Yuya said "Thank you so much to Lars and all of you who continue to work hard every day towards the launch of Chromagnon! I love Memory Palace. Luckily my Memory Palace display hasn't burned in yet, but I'm super nervous about it happening... Are there plans to release a new firmware that implements a screensaver like TBC2? Also, are there any plans to release a fan upgrade kit like TBC2? Thank you again!"</strong></p>
<p>Hello, Yuya. Thank you so much for your enthusiasm and support.  It is a relief on my stress levels and a boon to the projects we are working on to hear from you all like this.  As you can read above, the Memory Palace firmware update should help with your concerns about screen burn in.  I will definitely add a fan upgrade kit for Memory Palace to our project queue, now that TBC2 kits are out the door.</p>

<p>I am curious what user documentation projects you would like to see us tackle before the end of the year.  I want to know what would add the most value to your experience with LZX modules you already have. So if you have suggestions, please write to us.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in,
Lars</p>]]></content>

<p>Black prototypes of the Chromagnon plastic pieces and enclosure arrived, and the test fits are looking great.   The pieces below aren't final for the enclosure, but should give you the plan on how it all fits together.  Now that all the dimensional constraints are confirmed, I can make any cosmetic tweaks (rounded corners, for example) and order an initial production quantity.</p>

<p>Last week, we finally got the RevG core board built up. This week, I'm running through my checklist of revision items to make sure that everything that was corrected from RevF is now functioning as intended.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/chromag3-a05c4db0aa63c2783dda87dd2bc6eb32.png" width="480" height="360" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As we move into June, there are three main objectives on my plate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase an initial quantity of plastic parts and backlit film inserts for the LED grid. This will probably be 5-10 sets to start, and then we will ramp up if everything is going smoothly.</li>
<li>Finalize the testing platform for the existing Chromagnon control boards, and get an initial quantity of the existing control assemblies through testing.</li>
<li>Release V1.0 of the firmware, which still needs a few utility functions such as user firmware update procedure and some hardware self tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will all lead up to our "ship unit one" goal.  Once we hit that, we can transition into Chromagnon documentation, promotion, and ongoing production.</p>
<p>Thanks for being patient with me.  As I have brought up in the last couple posts, our team has downsized significantly since the beginning of the year -- this has pushed a large number of new tasks onto my plate personally, which has meant my time is split across Chromagnon, shipping, purchasing and managing ongoing production.  On one hand this has been intense, but on the other, the company is more stable and I feel like we are in better control of our path moving forward.</p>
<p>Here's a preview of the new Chromagnon patch design.  What do you think?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.lzxindustries.net/assets/images/patch-9223dbce04c509d7aea609267c809a34.png" width="445" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>And now, here are your questions since the last update.</p>
<p>Jeffrey asked, "Will the Chromagon make the Cyclops obsolete? If not, in what ways will the Cyclops still be relevant?﻿"</p>
<p>Chromagnon is not a direct replacement for Cyclops. Chromagnon is an integrated color vector and video processor with ILDA input and output.  Cyclops is an ILDA output module for EuroRack synthesizers. One way you could use them together is to use Cyclops to create patterns from your EuroRack synthesizer, and then use Chromagnon as a post-processor for the resulting patterns, between your EuroRack and your laser.</p>
<p>Paul Rogers asked, "Will LZX be embracing generative AI, and implementing it into to a module?"</p>
<p>Interesting question.  As a company dedicated to the longevity of analog and embedded hardware technology, any attempt to integrate Stable Diffusion algorithms, or generative models, into our gear would manifest as a program for one of our FPGA platforms like TBC2 or Memory Palace.  In a way, I feel like the tactile nature of analog feedback, and processing in general, is a different kind of generative intelligence and provides a necessary counterpoint to our culture's current obsession with generative algorithms and models.</p>
<p>In any case, I'm quite content focusing mostly on analog and partially on embedded digital for the foreseeable future. There are still countless ideas in this area that I would like for LZX to explore.  It is likely that we will develop new solutions for interfacing the analog worlds with the software worlds more seamlessly, rather than developing a generative AI product.</p>
<p>Dream Taser said, "Hi Lars! The Chromagnon updates are brontosaurus burgers for a hungry caveman! Much appreciated! I wanted to suggest something for the artwork… cavemen projecting torchlight on cave wall, perhaps some animated animals and something to do with northern lights 😁"</p>
<p>Brilliant ideas! I love the idea of cave paintings in torchlight. Beneath Chromagnon's cheeky persona, this idea is part of the instrumentation concept -- a connection to something primal and prehistoric. I hope Chromagnon taps into the firestarter and toolholder instincts in every human operator's brain, and that they feel personally connected to the visual results.  The initial visual metaphor I have had in my head from the beginning is the "primordial pool" -- a swirling, rotating mass of colors and ingredients.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow! April flew past, here at LZX HQ. Our improvements to operations and inventory have allowed us to process a large number of tasks in the ongoing effort to keep modules and stock while taking steady steps towards Chromagnon's launch.</p>

<p>A well organized inventory and resource planning system allows our small team to manage a large number of products and more accurately estimate production dates.</p>
<p>Since my last post, there have been two iterations of Chromagnon plastic parts, and I am waiting on a third batch in black to arrive. I am very happy with the fit and look of these components and feel like they add a lot to Chromagnon's personality.</p>

<p>Also arriving since my last post is Chromagnon's back panel PCB, which is where Chromagnon's cooling fan will mount.  I have a few adjustments to make on this part, but otherwise it looks nice.  The only remaining part of the assembly is the enclosure/shell piece -- I should be able to show that to you soon.  With all of those designs sealed, we will finally have the complete recipe card for this prehistoric video synthesizer.</p>
<p>Additionally, on the Chromagnon front, I have been reviewing our inventory of Chromagnon control assemblies. We have several hundred of these built, but they need functional testing. So we built a test wiring harness and embedded system to speed up that process.</p>
<p>In modular news, we received our production parts for the new case, now officially titled Vessel 168.  I'm so excited about how good the matte black powder coating looks on the sheet metal, and on the fit of all the components.  We'll have an initial batch of these up for sale in a few days. This initial offering is rack mountable, and includes a central DC &amp; Sync distribution bus, with 28 DC power jack outputs and 14 buffered sync outputs (with a single sync input).</p>
<p>Coming next for the case will be variants for 3U, the much requested briefcase version with lid and carrying handle, and a EuroRack power supply expander for powering your legacy modules.  Please let us know if you have any suggestions on what products you'd like to see in our catalog for case and case expander variations.</p>

<p>In TBC2 news, after much research and testing, we have made an ultra silent fan upgrade kit with installation instructions for the Gen3 (Mk2) and are currently making a similar kit for the Orion (Mk1) units.  Once we have both of those in stock, we'll have them available on the website. The fans in use on TBC2 have had a variable range of loudness, with some fans being annoying to some users.  The fans we used were initially designed for 3D printers, where noise is not a big concern -- so it's taken us a while to find fans in the right form factor which are also dead silent.  Also, the TBC2 Expander Mk2 I previewed in the last blog has been prototyped and looks great, so we are in the middle of building a batch.</p>
<p>Now, on to your questions:</p>
<p><strong>Pat asked "Are you really a few weeks away from shipping the first Chromagnon unit? How many weeks if you had to guess?"</strong></p>
<p>A better way to phrase that statement would have been "we are about 2 months behind the schedule we made back in December when the blog started." That schedule was looking to ship a first unit in April, so that would mean I am now hoping to be doing so by the end of June.  It's looking good that all the production related deliverables will get wrapped up this month (the final enclosure design is the biggest piece missing).  How fast we roll out production from that point, is still unknown -- but we are making steady forward progress.</p>
<p><strong>Michael asked "Do you know when the Proc might be reproduced? I have an order for it with Perfect Circuit but I don’t know if I should wait on that or, if it’s going to be on the other side of the Chromagnon stuff, just try and find one / something else on the used market. "</strong></p>
<p>We have Proc in stock here at LZX -- if Perfect Circuit don't have stock, they can place an order with us at any time.  It could be that they recently received a shipment from us, but have not put it into inventory yet.</p>
<p><strong>heavy light asked "I realise the team  are busy building /designing modules and all that but when are we getting some new t shirts ?"</strong></p>
<p>My comrade, there is a new shirt / patch / sticker design for Chromagnon in progress right now.  Dave, who designed the Vidiot &amp; Chromagnon characters is working on it. Please always let us know if you have suggestions for what merch or merch designs you want to see.  We love showing our personalities as designers in ways that extend beyond the products themselves. Since we were all in many bands at various points, merch is a big part of that!</p>
<p><strong>Aaron asked "Hi! I want to update my shipping address before you start sending out units; how can I do that?"</strong></p>
<p>You can update the shipping address for your order at any time by writing to <a href="mailto:sales@lzxindustries.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sales@lzxindustries.net</a>.  But don't worry -- we'll be reaching out to each and every customer individually before your shipment goes out, to confirm the details.  We don't want any Chromagnons lost in the mail!</p>
<p>The biweekly schedule has been working well for the blog, so I will be sticking with that moving forward.  I'm likely to issue more updates once we're past production/development goals and into a more promotional phase.</p>
<p>In totally unrelated news, I will be playing wargames at the fourth 3D Roleplay Con here in Portland over the weekend.  Please wish me many victories.</p>
<p>Until next time I remain faithfully yours,
Lars</p>]]></content>
