We received a tax bill in the past month that was several times higher than anything we've seen before. Those of you who have been following our company for a while know that we follow a market price methodology to pricing our products, which means that what you pay for them is a direct product of the hard costs involved in parts and labor -- in other words, if the cost of the parts go up, the price will need to go up at some point as well.  We aren't there yet, as we're hoping the situation will change.  If you've been looking at picking up some modules, it is a good time to get in before that happens.

We've been stuck at a stasis point on the next revision of that board for a few month, as you all are holding the line without much news.  I've realized that the integrated single board approach has been holding us back from finalizing the design, and that the lost time in sealing the design is costing us more than time spent on alternative approaches -- such as the modular subassemblies we were working on earlier in the project.  We've decided to pick up that thread and make a move toward a new version of the subassemblies, and integrating them into the next revision of the core.  This will ensure that we cut no corners when it comes to precision and stability, even though it will raise our production costs and labor when it comes time for production."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I'm happy to say that this effort has been a great success -- we've designed, built and validated 5 different submodules and their test boards in the past month.
