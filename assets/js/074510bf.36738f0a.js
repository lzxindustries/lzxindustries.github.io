At the heart of Chromagnon is a massive analog vector processor -- the algebraic functions inside take voltages representing 2D coordinates and transform them through user controls and high frequency voltage control. These 2D transformations such as size, position, rotation, and skew can be applied universally to any XY voltages! In Chromagnon's case, the front and  of the instrument offers four primary ways to source the initial signals: horizontal & vertical video ramp waveform generators, the UV chroma colorspace of a video input, the XY coordinates of an ILDA input (like the Neon Captain Radiator), or the UV chroma colorspace of an ILDA input.  So put more simply, Chromagnon can be used as an analog post processor for your laser visuals -- if your ILDA generator is creating a star shaped pattern, Chromagnon could be used, for example, to rotate, warp, resize, or animate that pattern."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:(0,a.jsxs)(o.strong,{children:['Michael asked "Hey Lars, I just placed a preorder for the Chromagnon and I was wondering two things\u2026First off, if I were to put together a 104hp skiff to complement it, are there any modules that having Chromagnon de-necessitates having?
