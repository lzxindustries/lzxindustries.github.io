LZX exists as a counterpoint to the worlds of mainstream broadcast equipment and GPU based video processing software.\r\nLZX started as a DIY project in 2008, and then evolved through several series of modular instrument designs. Previous generations of LZX modules were referred to as the Visionary series (2011), Expedition series (2015), and Orion series (2018). The current modular series (2022) is referred to as just LZX Modular, or Gen3.\r\nLZX products are manufactured in Portland, Oregon at the LZX workshop.\r\nModules are compatible with EuroRack cases and patch cables used by modular audio synthesizers.\r\nModules can be powered by 12V DC "wall wart" adapters or by EuroRack power supplies.\r\nExternal video inputs and outputs are the same as the Component & Composite connections found on most televisions and some cameras.\r\nPatchable signal levels are in the 0 to 1V range; This is lower than most audio modules (0V-10V), but inputs are tolerant of any voltage produced by a EuroRack system.\r\nVoltage control inputs are capable of very high frequencies, allowing signals such as camera images to modulate oscillators or VCAs.\r\n/media/GettingStartedWorkshop.jpg'}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"installing-modules",children:"Installing Modules"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Installing a new module in your system should be done in the following steps.

Underpowering your system can result in a variety of glitchy behavior. Add up the current consumption required by your LZX modules or by any other modules sharing the same power source, and verify that this is less than the current supplied by your power supply. If it is very close to, or greater than, the supplied current, upgrade your power supply.\r\nTry testing modules in isolation. Disconnect all modules from your system, and connect only the output module, such as ESG3, to the power supply. After verifying it works correctly, power up the next module. Keep going until your issue reappears. If the issue reappears near the power supply's limits, upgrade your power supply.

Try with another set of video cables no longer than 2 meters in length. If this resolves your issue, use the shorter cables. If you require a very long cable run, you may need to add a video distribution amplifier to your equipment list.\r\nYour ESG3 module may be defective. If none of the above solutions work, check to see if the issue goes away when you adjust the Contrast controls on your ESG3. If so, does the issue return when you recenter the controls? If so, this is most likely due to a PCB assembly or connector issue, such as a dry or unsoldered pad.
