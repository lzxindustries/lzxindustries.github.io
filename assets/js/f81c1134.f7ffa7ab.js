Rather than sending them to the junk, we\'ve been making progress over the Sumer on building up a limited batch of 24 units using those parts.  You can order one now at https://lzxindustries.net/products/vidiot\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./vidiot.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'ve made some revisions to our Double Vision system bundle -- including a full 3U EuroRack enclosure using our new sync and power distribution board architecture.  This version also includes the TBC2 expander, in lieu a DC Distro.  We have a couple systems in stock right now for purchse: at https://lzxindustries.net/products/double-vision-system\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./double-vision.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Chromagnon front, I have been laser focused (pun intended) on preparing the hardware for production.  After this last prototype review, the full context is a lot easier to see, including the remaining steps needed until we\'re actually placing the order for production core boards and molded parts. This process has been grueling, as the core board\'s BOM and parts count are massive. Thus, I\'ve been breaking some repetitive parts of the analog circuit into submodules. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of those submodules is a four quadrant multiplier sub-assembly that encapsulates our discrete design. This design is based on topologies in classic multiplier ICs such as MC1494 and MC1495, which are long obsolete.  A core requirement of the Chromagnon design is the implementation of this discrete multiplier, as there are over 20 of them in its analog circuit!  We\'ve been working on this circuit since before Chromagnon was even conceived, and after so many revisions I\'m very pleased with how it is performing.  Here\'s a look at the submodule.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./submodule.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis submodule is being reintegrated into Chromagnon\'s core board, which reduces the BOM count by a few hundred parts and will allow pre-testing/calibration of the analog circuit. We have already received our initial order of these submodules and are testing them now. \\r\\n\\r\\nRevisions to Chromagnon Core RevH will be ordered by the end of this week.  I\'m not used to spending entire weeks on a single PCB layout, so that gives you an idea of the scale of the effort required to push this forward. This is the first version of the board that is being 100% assembled out of our workshop, which means we\'re priming it to be ready to go, and it is a candidate for production.  I\'d love to have it all confirmed and initial quantities ordered by the end of October -- there\'s not a lot left to stand in our way of that happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, here are answers to the questions you have submitted since the last update:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Marty asked, \\"Looking forward to shipping on Chromagnon. Well done on all the work so far. When shipping does occur. Will the cost of the unit, detailed for customs. Reflect the date of purchase or current value? I\'m just worried about the extra tax I\'m going to pay when it ships to Australia.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi, Marty. The customs info will reflect the price you paid on your original sales invoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pat asked, \\"Can we expect Chromagnon unit #1 to ship out by Halloween?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably not, Pat!  In the next Chromagnon milestone, I\'m hoping to be telling you we\'ve got RevH confirmed and have ordered initial production parts. That is getting very close, and would mean we have unit #1 here. Whether or not it\'s shipping by that date, I don\'t know -- firmware is about 95% done, but there\'s still a few items to wrap up and test once the hardware is sealed.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Paul asked, \\"Would it be possible to demonstrate through your LZX documentation learning program, the placement and attachment of modules into a Vessel or eurorack case? And if any modules have to be linked together or sync. This is for those who don\u2019t know. Thank you.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi Paul. Yes, certainly! We do have a basic guide to doing this on our website at https://lzxindustries.net/getting-started. However, I\'d love to expand on that and have some videos and better photos to go along with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil next time,\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"light-at-the-end","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/light-at-the-end","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-31-light-at-the-end copy/index.md","title":"Light At The End","description":"I hope everyone has enjoyed their Summers and is looking forward to the Fall.

Unlike software based visual generators, or simpler analog circuits (like our modules), Chromagnon is a design that has been very difficult to show as a work in progress until all of the pieces, both hardware and firmware, were in play.  I am very glad to be at this point, because you\'ll no longer have to take my word for it when it comes to what, how, and why Chromagnon does what it does.\\r\\n\\r\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhlNyixE1vo?si=Vl5htKHzqpl1NEQK\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./testing.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nTesting in progress.  Excuse the clutter!\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ll be recording more in September, including a walk through of Chromagnon\'s user interface and functions, as we continue checking off items on our test list and working towards finalization of the design for production.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince our last update, we have one new user question. \\r\\n\\r\\n** Pete said \\"Hi, Lars! Glad to hear your progress update, it must feel pretty good to get out of the cave and into the light!  I\'m curious as to what h/w you have chosen for the Chromagnon. I\'m interested in FPGAs and have ordered a Zybo board to experiment with.\\" **\\r\\n\\r\\nPete, thanks for writing!  Chromagnon\'s hardware is quite intensive.  At it\'s core, it is an analog synthesizer with a fully analog, wideband signal path -- but also, there is a complex digital embedded system which handles the user interface, video input decoding and scaling (SD to HD and HD to SD), and 10-bit ramp waveform generation. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the digital system, we are using a System-on-Module from MYiR, which you can read more about here. This is based on the Xilinx Zynq system on chip -- the same as employed on your Zybo board.  Xilinx FPGAs are used heavily in broadcast and imaging applications of all kinds. On our host board, we use video encoding and decoding interface ICs such as the ADV7181C, ADV7123 and ADV7125 for interfacing analog video with the Zynq IO ports. I hope you have fun with the Zybo board!\\r\\n\\r\\nTalk to you again soon,\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"code-cave","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/code-cave","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-08-code-cave/index.md","title":"Code Cave","description":"Over the past several weeks I have been writing Chromagnon\u2019s firmware, and I\u2019m happy to say that I now have a complete version ready for testing.

So let my eyeballs readjust \u2013 this blog will mostly be about the software.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./chromagnon.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n*My trusty Chromagnon RevG development unit, back at the test bench*\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Memory Palace and TBC2 to Chromagnon, I have needed to double down on my embedded software skills. Approaching these instruments, I had many firmware and software projects behind me \u2013 but none at this level of structural complexity.  So I was surprised by the scale of what I still needed to learn with regards to architectural patterns and systems level design. Hardware scales easily \u2013 five circuits is five circuits \u2013 but in software, writing a state control system for five asynchronous modules is a different beast entirely.  The experience has definitely kindled a love for embedded development with modern C++ in general, and I look forward to doing more of it. During the past few weeks of getting cozy with Chromagnon\u2019s digital brain, I felt both confident and effective, and that was a relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\u2019s next? With firmware in place, we are able to move into a new verification process for the instrument as a whole.  That\u2019s a long list of tests, including nearly 200 different video input conversion modes \u2013 in addition to all combinations of Chromagnon\u2019s 12 compositor modes, 3 chroma modes, 3 luma modes, and 4 primary modes. Most of this testing has already been done with prior versions of the hardware, but we still need to repeat the tests now that we have a firmware candidate. In the next blog, I\u2019ll describe how that\u2019s going.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other news, we have added the DIY kit version of our power & sync distribution busboard to the webstore.  Check that out here.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./sync.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also have a restock of Scrolls hitting the shelf. While I have not had time to film it yet, here is a script for a video about Scrolls that you may read. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Summer sale is active, with discounts offered on Sum/Dist, Contour and Matte modules. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'re still taking orders for Double Vision systems. It has been exciting to watch new video artists dig into the depths of their systems over the Summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are your questions, since the last post.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Luis asked, \\"Are there any plans to further improve the Memory Palace firmware?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nMemory Palace Mk2 will be a follow-up project after Chromagnon. The first phase of that project will include some revisions to the existing Mk1 firmware, as our plan is to support concurrent versions. The main difference being that Mk2 will support HD modes. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Mat asked, \\"Just curious about the timeframe in regards to the Double Vision preorder. Will there be a long wait? I just ordered recently and will hopefully not have to wait as long as I have for the Chromagnon.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we launched the Double Vision system bundle, the average wait time for a shipment has been about 3 weeks.  I expect that to stay consistent.  We have a good flow coming thru the workshop of stocking the module sets in small batches. Your Double Vision is actually in QC today, and planning to ship tomorrow.  You sent in this question on July 15th, so that seems pretty consistent with the average lead time.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Thomas asked, \\"Are preorders for the Chromagnon still open? Nothing happens when I press the preorder button, and I see people selling their preorder slots online.  Am I too late to buy one?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nPreorders are open. If you click the preorder button on the product page, you should see it added to your shopping cart (but the site doesn\'t automatically take you there.)  This is not a limited edition -- the date we have Chromagnons in stock and all preorders are fulfilled is still uncertain, but you don\'t need to worry about missing out.  We hope to keep the instrument in production for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Patrick said, \\"It seems like a lot is happening over there right now, and there are many updates and things to discuss in each monthly journal post. Is there any inclination to get back to doing a weekly journal post to keep us more in the loop? Or would that slow production down because it\'s another thing to think about? Either way, I\'m glad Chromagnon is still being worked on. Since June has come and gone, is there any new estimate for when the first unit might ship out?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nPatrick, I\'m sorry the updates have been less frequent.  Currently the core team is down to myself full time and three part timers.  Writing these blog posts is no huge burden, but it does take 2-3 hours out of my work week each time. With hardware development and workshop projects, tasks are shorter -- 1 to 16 hrs each -- to do a board layout, or revision, or build a prototype.  With software or circuit design it\'s often 3-6 week sprints, during which it can be difficult for me to do anything but write code or run simulations.  With code sprints in the rear window for now, I\'ll try to up the pace of the updates.  I\'m hoping to be past hardware verification and on to production and user docs soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Kazys asked, \\"How effective is Chromagnon with a Vectrex? Can it do Rutt-Etra style rescanning into X / Y / Z out of the box?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have not recorded any Vectrex monitor tests yet, and that should be the final judge of this -- but you\'ve got the right idea. The scaler decimation settings allow you to output low frequency rasters for lower bandwidth displays, like laser projectors and the Vectrex. I expect some of the middle settings to be right for use with the Vectrex -- a raster size of 120x68, for example.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Kazys also asked, \\"If I have a Chromagnon, why would I need an ESG3? Is it still useful?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely. Chromagnon has no dedicated RGB level or offset controls, so ESG3 would add a lot, with each of ESG3\'s six knobs and three switches representing parameters not present on Chromagnon.  Another reason to have an ESG3 is if you are using Chromagnon in the context of a modular system, and want to mix it\'s output with other sources before the final output. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have questions about hardware development, software development, LZX, or you just need someone to talk to, write to me here:  https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA\\r\\n\\r\\n- Lars"}]}}')}}]);
