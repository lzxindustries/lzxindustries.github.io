All of the firmware validation of the platform to be used in Videomancer and the Chromagnon revisions has been accomplished over the Summer, and we're very happy with how it's performing.

If we are doing strongly after the Videomancer launch and sales season, we will build Chromagnon in large batches, outsourcing extra help, and hoping to ship all orders in 1-3 waves of shipments.  If that is not possible, we will be merging Chromagnon into the Videomancer production pipeline and start making monthly shipments of a variable number of units dependent on our logistical constraints at the time.
