Simplify your patch to the least number of cables or connections that create the issue you're seeing. Sometimes this will reveal the problem. If you jump into more complex theories right away, you may miss simple answers, like a defective patch cable or a missed setting.\r\nYour 12V power supply or EuroRack power supply may not be supplying enough current. Underpowering your system can result in a variety of glitchy behavior. Add up the current consumption required by your LZX modules or by any other modules sharing the same power source, and verify that this is less than the current supplied by your power supply. If it is very close to, or greater than, the supplied current, upgrade your power supply.\r\nTry testing modules in isolation. Disconnect all modules from your system, and connect only the output module, such as ESG3, to the power supply. After verifying it works correctly, power up the next module. Keep going until your issue reappears. If the issue reappears near the power supply's limits, upgrade your power supply. If the issue seems to be connected to a specific module, focus on troubleshooting that module.\r\nI am seeing my LZX Modular system's video output drop in and out on my video monitor or video recording device, resulting in missing frames."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Your video device might be defective. Verify that your video device can display video signals from a different video source of the same video format, using a different set of video cables. If you see the same issue, your device is defective. Contact the manufacturer of your video device for advice on further troubleshooting.\r\nYour video cables might be defective. Try with another set of video cables. If your issue has been resolved with the new cables, your video cables were defective.\r\nYour video cables might be too long. Try with another set of video cables no longer than 2 meters in length. If this resolves your issue, use the shorter cables. If you require a very long cable run, you may need to add a video distribution amplifier to your equipment list.\r\nYour ESG3 module may be defective. If none of the above solutions work, check to see if the issue goes away when you adjust the Contrast controls on your ESG3. If so, does the issue return when you recenter the controls? If so, this is most likely due to a PCB assembly or connector issue, such as a dry or unsoldered pad. The issue can be resolved by service or replacement performed by a qualified technician at LZX.\r\nMy ESG3 doesn't work sometimes when I power my system on.

For many, the ability to verify a module is operating properly is useful for troubleshooting a complex system. For others, using electronic test equipment like oscilloscopes, multimeters and firmware programmers is part of their relationship to the instrument. With this in mind, we present models for both basic functional testing and advanced testing and calibration. We would love to see LZX Modular equipment in use several centuries from now, due to the diligence and care taken by its community of users."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:o}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return o?(0,s.jsx)(o,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},8453:(e,o,t)=>{t.d(o,{R:()=>n,x:()=>a});var s=t(6540);const r={},i=s.createContext(r);function n(e){const o=s.useContext(i);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(o):{...o,...e}}),[o,e])}function a(e){let o;return o=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:n(e.components),s.createElement(i.Provider,{value:o},e.children)}}}]);
