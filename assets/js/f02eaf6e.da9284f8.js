LZX exists as a counterpoint to the worlds of mainstream broadcast equipment and GPU based video processing software.\r\nLZX started as a DIY project in 2008, and then evolved through several series of modular instrument designs. Previous generations of LZX modules were referred to as the Visionary series (2011), Expedition series (2015), and Orion series (2018). The current modular series (2022) is referred to as just LZX Modular, or Gen3.\r\nLZX products are manufactured in Portland, Oregon at the LZX workshop.\r\nModules are compatible with EuroRack cases and patch cables used by modular audio synthesizers.\r\nModules can be powered by 12V DC "wall wart" adapters or by EuroRack power supplies.\r\nExternal video inputs and outputs are the same as the Component & Composite connections found on most televisions and some cameras.\r\nPatchable signal levels are in the 0 to 1V range; This is lower than most audio modules (0V-10V), but inputs are tolerant of any voltage produced by a EuroRack system.\r\nVoltage control inputs are capable of very high frequencies, allowing signals such as camera images to modulate oscillators or VCAs.\r\n/media/GettingStartedWorkshop.jpg'})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8453:(e,t,s)=>{s.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>i});var o=s(6540);const n={},r=o.createContext(n);function a(e){const t=o.useContext(r);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:a(e.components),o.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
