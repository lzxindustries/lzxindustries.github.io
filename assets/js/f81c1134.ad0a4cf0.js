Rather than sending them to the junk, we\'ve been making progress over the Sumer on building up a limited batch of 24 units using those parts.  You can order one now at https://lzxindustries.net/products/vidiot\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./vidiot.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'ve made some revisions to our Double Vision system bundle -- including a full 3U EuroRack enclosure using our new sync and power distribution board architecture.  This version also includes the TBC2 expander, in lieu a DC Distro.  We have a couple systems in stock right now for purchse: at https://lzxindustries.net/products/double-vision-system\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./double-vision.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Chromagnon front, I have been laser focused (pun intended) on preparing the hardware for production.  After this last prototype review, the full context is a lot easier to see, including the remaining steps needed until we\'re actually placing the order for production core boards and molded parts. This process has been grueling, as the core board\'s BOM and parts count are massive. Thus, I\'ve been breaking some repetitive parts of the analog circuit into submodules. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of those submodules is a four quadrant multiplier sub-assembly that encapsulates our discrete design. This design is based on topologies in classic multiplier ICs such as MC1494 and MC1495, which are long obsolete.  A core requirement of the Chromagnon design is the implementation of this discrete multiplier, as there are over 20 of them in its analog circuit!  We\'ve been working on this circuit since before Chromagnon was even conceived, and after so many revisions I\'m very pleased with how it is performing.  Here\'s a look at the submodule.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./submodule.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis submodule is being reintegrated into Chromagnon\'s core board, which reduces the BOM count by a few hundred parts and will allow pre-testing/calibration of the analog circuit. We have already received our initial order of these submodules and are testing them now. \\r\\n\\r\\nRevisions to Chromagnon Core RevH will be ordered by the end of this week.  I\'m not used to spending entire weeks on a single PCB layout, so that gives you an idea of the scale of the effort required to push this forward. This is the first version of the board that is being 100% assembled out of our workshop, which means we\'re priming it to be ready to go, and it is a candidate for production.  I\'d love to have it all confirmed and initial quantities ordered by the end of October -- there\'s not a lot left to stand in our way of that happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, here are answers to the questions you have submitted since the last update:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Marty asked, \\"Looking forward to shipping on Chromagnon. Well done on all the work so far. When shipping does occur. Will the cost of the unit, detailed for customs. Reflect the date of purchase or current value? I\'m just worried about the extra tax I\'m going to pay when it ships to Australia.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi, Marty. The customs info will reflect the price you paid on your original sales invoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pat asked, \\"Can we expect Chromagnon unit #1 to ship out by Halloween?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably not, Pat!  In the next Chromagnon milestone, I\'m hoping to be telling you we\'ve got RevH confirmed and have ordered initial production parts. That is getting very close, and would mean we have unit #1 here. Whether or not it\'s shipping by that date, I don\'t know -- firmware is about 95% done, but there\'s still a few items to wrap up and test once the hardware is sealed.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Paul asked, \\"Would it be possible to demonstrate through your LZX documentation learning program, the placement and attachment of modules into a Vessel or eurorack case? And if any modules have to be linked together or sync. This is for those who don\u2019t know. Thank you.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi Paul. Yes, certainly! We do have a basic guide to doing this on our website at https://lzxindustries.net/getting-started. However, I\'d love to expand on that and have some videos and better photos to go along with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil next time,\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"light-at-the-end","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/light-at-the-end","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-31-light-at-the-end/index.md","title":"Light At The End","description":"I hope everyone has enjoyed their Summers and is looking forward to the Fall.

Unlike software based visual generators, or simpler analog circuits (like our modules), Chromagnon is a design that has been very difficult to show as a work in progress until all of the pieces, both hardware and firmware, were in play.  I am very glad to be at this point, because you\'ll no longer have to take my word for it when it comes to what, how, and why Chromagnon does what it does.\\r\\n\\r\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhlNyixE1vo?si=Vl5htKHzqpl1NEQK\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./testing.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nTesting in progress.  Excuse the clutter!\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ll be recording more in September, including a walk through of Chromagnon\'s user interface and functions, as we continue checking off items on our test list and working towards finalization of the design for production.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince our last update, we have one new user question. \\r\\n\\r\\n** Pete said \\"Hi, Lars! Glad to hear your progress update, it must feel pretty good to get out of the cave and into the light!  I\'m curious as to what h/w you have chosen for the Chromagnon. I\'m interested in FPGAs and have ordered a Zybo board to experiment with.\\" **\\r\\n\\r\\nPete, thanks for writing!  Chromagnon\'s hardware is quite intensive.  At it\'s core, it is an analog synthesizer with a fully analog, wideband signal path -- but also, there is a complex digital embedded system which handles the user interface, video input decoding and scaling (SD to HD and HD to SD), and 10-bit ramp waveform generation. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the digital system, we are using a System-on-Module from MYiR, which you can read more about here. This is based on the Xilinx Zynq system on chip -- the same as employed on your Zybo board.  Xilinx FPGAs are used heavily in broadcast and imaging applications of all kinds. On our host board, we use video encoding and decoding interface ICs such as the ADV7181C, ADV7123 and ADV7125 for interfacing analog video with the Zynq IO ports. I hope you have fun with the Zybo board!\\r\\n\\r\\nTalk to you again soon,\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"code-cave","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/code-cave","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-08-code-cave/index.md","title":"Code Cave","description":"Over the past several weeks I have been writing Chromagnon\u2019s firmware, and I\u2019m happy to say that I now have a complete version ready for testing.

Approaching these instruments, I had many firmware and software projects behind me \u2013 but none at this level of structural complexity.  So I was surprised by the scale of what I still needed to learn with regards to architectural patterns and systems level design. Hardware scales easily \u2013 five circuits is five circuits \u2013 but in software, writing a state control system for five asynchronous modules is a different beast entirely.  The experience has definitely kindled a love for embedded development with modern C++ in general, and I look forward to doing more of it. During the past few weeks of getting cozy with Chromagnon\u2019s digital brain, I felt both confident and effective, and that was a relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\u2019s next? With firmware in place, we are able to move into a new verification process for the instrument as a whole.  That\u2019s a long list of tests, including nearly 200 different video input conversion modes \u2013 in addition to all combinations of Chromagnon\u2019s 12 compositor modes, 3 chroma modes, 3 luma modes, and 4 primary modes. Most of this testing has already been done with prior versions of the hardware, but we still need to repeat the tests now that we have a firmware candidate. In the next blog, I\u2019ll describe how that\u2019s going.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other news, we have added the DIY kit version of our power & sync distribution busboard to the webstore.  Check that out here.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./sync.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also have a restock of Scrolls hitting the shelf. While I have not had time to film it yet, here is a script for a video about Scrolls that you may read. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Summer sale is active, with discounts offered on Sum/Dist, Contour and Matte modules. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'re still taking orders for Double Vision systems. It has been exciting to watch new video artists dig into the depths of their systems over the Summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are your questions, since the last post.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Luis asked, \\"Are there any plans to further improve the Memory Palace firmware?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nMemory Palace Mk2 will be a follow-up project after Chromagnon. The first phase of that project will include some revisions to the existing Mk1 firmware, as our plan is to support concurrent versions. The main difference being that Mk2 will support HD modes. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Mat asked, \\"Just curious about the timeframe in regards to the Double Vision preorder. Will there be a long wait? I just ordered recently and will hopefully not have to wait as long as I have for the Chromagnon.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we launched the Double Vision system bundle, the average wait time for a shipment has been about 3 weeks.  I expect that to stay consistent.  We have a good flow coming thru the workshop of stocking the module sets in small batches. Your Double Vision is actually in QC today, and planning to ship tomorrow.  You sent in this question on July 15th, so that seems pretty consistent with the average lead time.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Thomas asked, \\"Are preorders for the Chromagnon still open? Nothing happens when I press the preorder button, and I see people selling their preorder slots online.  Am I too late to buy one?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nPreorders are open. If you click the preorder button on the product page, you should see it added to your shopping cart (but the site doesn\'t automatically take you there.)  This is not a limited edition -- the date we have Chromagnons in stock and all preorders are fulfilled is still uncertain, but you don\'t need to worry about missing out.  We hope to keep the instrument in production for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Patrick said, \\"It seems like a lot is happening over there right now, and there are many updates and things to discuss in each monthly journal post. Is there any inclination to get back to doing a weekly journal post to keep us more in the loop? Or would that slow production down because it\'s another thing to think about? Either way, I\'m glad Chromagnon is still being worked on. Since June has come and gone, is there any new estimate for when the first unit might ship out?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nPatrick, I\'m sorry the updates have been less frequent.  Currently the core team is down to myself full time and three part timers.  Writing these blog posts is no huge burden, but it does take 2-3 hours out of my work week each time. With hardware development and workshop projects, tasks are shorter -- 1 to 16 hrs each -- to do a board layout, or revision, or build a prototype.  With software or circuit design it\'s often 3-6 week sprints, during which it can be difficult for me to do anything but write code or run simulations.  With code sprints in the rear window for now, I\'ll try to up the pace of the updates.  I\'m hoping to be past hardware verification and on to production and user docs soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Kazys asked, \\"How effective is Chromagnon with a Vectrex? Can it do Rutt-Etra style rescanning into X / Y / Z out of the box?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have not recorded any Vectrex monitor tests yet, and that should be the final judge of this -- but you\'ve got the right idea. The scaler decimation settings allow you to output low frequency rasters for lower bandwidth displays, like laser projectors and the Vectrex. I expect some of the middle settings to be right for use with the Vectrex -- a raster size of 120x68, for example.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Kazys also asked, \\"If I have a Chromagnon, why would I need an ESG3? Is it still useful?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely. Chromagnon has no dedicated RGB level or offset controls, so ESG3 would add a lot, with each of ESG3\'s six knobs and three switches representing parameters not present on Chromagnon.  Another reason to have an ESG3 is if you are using Chromagnon in the context of a modular system, and want to mix it\'s output with other sources before the final output. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have questions about hardware development, software development, LZX, or you just need someone to talk to, write to me here:  https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA\\r\\n\\r\\n- Lars"},{"id":"summer-crunch","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/summer-crunch","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-29-summer-crunch/index.md","title":"Summer Crunch","description":"Dear video friends,","date":"2024-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Chromagnon","permalink":"/blog/tags/chromagnon","description":"Posts about the Chromagnon video synthesizer"}],"readingTime":5.64,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Larsen","title":"Product Designer","url":"https://github.com/creatorlars","imageURL":"https://github.com/creatorlars.png","key":"lars","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"summer-crunch","title":"Summer Crunch","authors":["lars"],"tags":["chromagnon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Code Cave","permalink":"/blog/code-cave"},"nextItem":{"title":"Chromagnon Box","permalink":"/blog/chromagnon-box"}},"content":"Dear video friends, \\r\\n\\r\\nJune has seen a lot of projects landing at the workshop and some significant pushes in firmware development. Over the Spring we have transitioned into outsourcing SMT assembly of our modules in smaller batches, in an effort to keep things stocked and flowing, and those efforts are running smoothly. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Summer is traditionally a period of low sales for us, so we have decided to open a sale for some modules we have lots of stock of. You will find Contour, Matte, and Sum/Dist have been marked down 25%, for the time being, on our webstore. If you\'ve been wanting to pick one of these up, now is a good time to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a summary of notable recent milestones:\\r\\n\\r\\nTBC2 1.0.3 firmware was released.  This includes better support for the VGA input expander and the addition of a 240p input mode.  So pull out your SNES and Chrono Trigger cartridge if you want to travel thru time, saving the world from Lavos, while also traveling thru your analog video circuits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you had an outstanding order for the TBC2 VGA input expander module, it has been shipped.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now stocking fan upgrade kits for TBC2 Mk1 & Mk2 on our webstore.  If you already ordered the Mk1 (Orion style) kits from us, we neglected to send mounting screws in the first few shipments -- but the screws have already been mailed to you in a separate package this week.  So look out for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMemory Palace 2.0.2 firmware was released.  This is a maintenance release which includes a screensaver function to prevent burn-in on your OLED screen in the case that you are logging lots of hours on your device. \\r\\n\\r\\nTBC2\'s video engine firmware has been ported to Chromagnon and is running on the new RevG PCB assembly.  I\'ve put a lot of time into merging work from TBC2 into a common library that is now shared with Chromagnon, to ensure consistent performance across both devices.  This will also set the stage for Memory Palace Mk2 revisions, which will be the big project after Chromagnon development has wrapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis past week I have written a parameter state engine, with auto recovery from loss of power or corrupted backups, to use across our firmware for various modules.  This will ensure that Chromagnon boots back up in the same state in which it was powered down. We\'ll be able to integrate that functionality into the next firmware release for TBC2 as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nEntering July, I am still investing most of my time into Chromagnon firmware and hardware review.  This includes writing tests for validating the control assemblies we\'ve already built and the RevG hardware.  Currently I am improving the software that allows for firmware update from MicroSD card, since with Chromagnon it needs to run in a headless manner. (Unlike TBC2 and Memory Palace, which both used OLED screens and keypads.) \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./thermal-camera.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n*Chromagnon RevG under the thermal camera!*\\r\\n\\r\\nA few background projects landed in June as well, including some parts we will use to revise the Cadet DIY series.  This maintenance revision will be ongoing for a few months, and will bring the core DIY modules up to spec for HD video synthesis timing, and offer some new supply chain/build options for hard to source components.  Once these revisions are complete, we\'ll offer the PCB and frontpanel sets again via our webstore.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./thonk-cadets.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOur order from Thonk for parts to use in building Cadet revisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our ongoing initiative to offer a line of professional enclosures for our modules, the pieces for a 3U variant of our 6U rackmount case have arrived.  These will be an upgrade option for your Double Vision system, and we\'ll soon offer a version of the Double Vision system which uses this case.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case-3u.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n3U variant of our powered EuroRack case for video synthesizers\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, a kit variant of our 10 amp DC power and sync distribution bus has arrived, for DIY installations into other cases. This version includes a chassis-mounted DC input jack and screw terminals on the PCB.  The busboard is equivalent to three times the amount of power and number of connectors as our 4HP DC distro module, and it will be suitable for powering cases of Gen3 modules over 252HP.   Look for this on our webstore in July.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext case projects will include a portable variant with a lid, and a legacy power supply expander for the 6U and portable cases.  The legacy power supply expander will be perfect for powering audio modules or older generations of LZX modules using the new Vessel cases.  I\'m excited to have a case that works with everything.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pat asked \\"The prototypes for the plastic pieces and enclosure look great! I\u2019m stoked that you guys have come this far with the project!. A few weeks ago you said you are hoping to ship unit one in June, is that still the plan?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi, Pat. Thanks!! We are getting close to that point. The Summer slump I mentioned slowed us down slightly -- and I squeezed in the TBC2 and Memory Palace updates that folks have been waiting on for a while, which delayed us as well. With the firmware project above wrapped up, we will be close to shipping the first unit.  Then we can roll up our sleeves and get our headspace shifted into rolling into a rhythm with the remaining Chromagnon production, documentation, and fulfillment.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Yuya said \\"Thank you so much to Lars and all of you who continue to work hard every day towards the launch of Chromagnon! I love Memory Palace. Luckily my Memory Palace display hasn\'t burned in yet, but I\'m super nervous about it happening... Are there plans to release a new firmware that implements a screensaver like TBC2? Also, are there any plans to release a fan upgrade kit like TBC2? Thank you again!\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHello, Yuya. Thank you so much for your enthusiasm and support.  It is a relief on my stress levels and a boon to the projects we are working on to hear from you all like this.  As you can read above, the Memory Palace firmware update should help with your concerns about screen burn in.  I will definitely add a fan upgrade kit for Memory Palace to our project queue, now that TBC2 kits are out the door. \\r\\n\\r\\nGot more questions, suggestions, comments or high fives?

This week, I\'m running through my checklist of revision items to make sure that everything that was corrected from RevF is now functioning as intended.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./chromag3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we move into June, there are three main objectives on my plate:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Purchase an initial quantity of plastic parts and backlit film inserts for the LED grid. This will probably be 5-10 sets to start, and then we will ramp up if everything is going smoothly.\\r\\n2) Finalize the testing platform for the existing Chromagnon control boards, and get an initial quantity of the existing control assemblies through testing.\\r\\n3) Release V1.0 of the firmware, which still needs a few utility functions such as user firmware update procedure and some hardware self tests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will all lead up to our \\"ship unit one\\" goal.  Once we hit that, we can transition into Chromagnon documentation, promotion, and ongoing production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for being patient with me.  As I have brought up in the last couple posts, our team has downsized significantly since the beginning of the year -- this has pushed a large number of new tasks onto my plate personally, which has meant my time is split across Chromagnon, shipping, purchasing and managing ongoing production.  On one hand this has been intense, but on the other, the company is more stable and I feel like we are in better control of our path moving forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\'s a preview of the new Chromagnon patch design.  What do you think?\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./patch.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, here are your questions since the last update.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeffrey asked, \\"Will the Chromagon make the Cyclops obsolete? If not, in what ways will the Cyclops still be relevant?\ufeff\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChromagnon is not a direct replacement for Cyclops. Chromagnon is an integrated color vector and video processor with ILDA input and output.  Cyclops is an ILDA output module for EuroRack synthesizers. One way you could use them together is to use Cyclops to create patterns from your EuroRack synthesizer, and then use Chromagnon as a post-processor for the resulting patterns, between your EuroRack and your laser.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Rogers asked, \\"Will LZX be embracing generative AI, and implementing it into to a module?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInteresting question.  As a company dedicated to the longevity of analog and embedded hardware technology, any attempt to integrate Stable Diffusion algorithms, or generative models, into our gear would manifest as a program for one of our FPGA platforms like TBC2 or Memory Palace.  In a way, I feel like the tactile nature of analog feedback, and processing in general, is a different kind of generative intelligence and provides a necessary counterpoint to our culture\'s current obsession with generative algorithms and models.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn any case, I\'m quite content focusing mostly on analog and partially on embedded digital for the foreseeable future. There are still countless ideas in this area that I would like for LZX to explore.  It is likely that we will develop new solutions for interfacing the analog worlds with the software worlds more seamlessly, rather than developing a generative AI product.\\r\\n\\r\\nDream Taser said, \\"Hi Lars! The Chromagnon updates are brontosaurus burgers for a hungry caveman! Much appreciated! I wanted to suggest something for the artwork\u2026 cavemen projecting torchlight on cave wall, perhaps some animated animals and something to do with northern lights \ud83d\ude01\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrilliant ideas! I love the idea of cave paintings in torchlight. Beneath Chromagnon\'s cheeky persona, this idea is part of the instrumentation concept -- a connection to something primal and prehistoric. I hope Chromagnon taps into the firestarter and toolholder instincts in every human operator\'s brain, and that they feel personally connected to the visual results.  The initial visual metaphor I have had in my head from the beginning is the \\"primordial pool\\" -- a swirling, rotating mass of colors and ingredients. \\r\\n\\r\\nGot more questions?

April flew past, here at LZX HQ. Our improvements to operations and inventory have allowed us to process a large number of tasks in the ongoing effort to keep modules and stock while taking steady steps towards Chromagnon\'s launch. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./workshop.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nA well organized inventory and resource planning system allows our small team to manage a large number of products and more accurately estimate production dates.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince my last post, there have been two iterations of Chromagnon plastic parts, and I am waiting on a third batch in black to arrive. I am very happy with the fit and look of these components and feel like they add a lot to Chromagnon\'s personality. \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./chromag.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso arriving since my last post is Chromagnon\'s back panel PCB, which is where Chromagnon\'s cooling fan will mount.  I have a few adjustments to make on this part, but otherwise it looks nice.  The only remaining part of the assembly is the enclosure/shell piece -- I should be able to show that to you soon.  With all of those designs sealed, we will finally have the complete recipe card for this prehistoric video synthesizer. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, on the Chromagnon front, I have been reviewing our inventory of Chromagnon control assemblies. We have several hundred of these built, but they need functional testing. So we built a test wiring harness and embedded system to speed up that process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modular news, we received our production parts for the new case, now officially titled Vessel 168.  I\'m so excited about how good the matte black powder coating looks on the sheet metal, and on the fit of all the components.  We\'ll have an initial batch of these up for sale in a few days. This initial offering is rack mountable, and includes a central DC & Sync distribution bus, with 28 DC power jack outputs and 14 buffered sync outputs (with a single sync input).\\r\\n\\r\\nComing next for the case will be variants for 3U, the much requested briefcase version with lid and carrying handle, and a EuroRack power supply expander for powering your legacy modules.  Please let us know if you have any suggestions on what products you\'d like to see in our catalog for case and case expander variations.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn TBC2 news, after much research and testing, we have made an ultra silent fan upgrade kit with installation instructions for the Gen3 (Mk2) and are currently making a similar kit for the Orion (Mk1) units.  Once we have both of those in stock, we\'ll have them available on the website. The fans in use on TBC2 have had a variable range of loudness, with some fans being annoying to some users.  The fans we used were initially designed for 3D printers, where noise is not a big concern -- so it\'s taken us a while to find fans in the right form factor which are also dead silent.  Also, the TBC2 Expander Mk2 I previewed in the last blog has been prototyped and looks great, so we are in the middle of building a batch.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, on to your questions:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pat asked \\"Are you really a few weeks away from shipping the first Chromagnon unit? How many weeks if you had to guess?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nA better way to phrase that statement would have been \\"we are about 2 months behind the schedule we made back in December when the blog started.\\" That schedule was looking to ship a first unit in April, so that would mean I am now hoping to be doing so by the end of June.  It\'s looking good that all the production related deliverables will get wrapped up this month (the final enclosure design is the biggest piece missing).  How fast we roll out production from that point, is still unknown -- but we are making steady forward progress.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Michael asked \\"Do you know when the Proc might be reproduced? I have an order for it with Perfect Circuit but I don\u2019t know if I should wait on that or, if it\u2019s going to be on the other side of the Chromagnon stuff, just try and find one / something else on the used market. \\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have Proc in stock here at LZX -- if Perfect Circuit don\'t have stock, they can place an order with us at any time.  It could be that they recently received a shipment from us, but have not put it into inventory yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n**heavy light asked \\"I realise the team  are busy building /designing modules and all that but when are we getting some new t shirts ?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nMy comrade, there is a new shirt / patch / sticker design for Chromagnon in progress right now.  Dave, who designed the Vidiot & Chromagnon characters is working on it. Please always let us know if you have suggestions for what merch or merch designs you want to see.  We love showing our personalities as designers in ways that extend beyond the products themselves. Since we were all in many bands at various points, merch is a big part of that!\\r\\n\\r\\n**Aaron asked \\"Hi! I want to update my shipping address before you start sending out units; how can I do that?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can update the shipping address for your order at any time by writing to sales@lzxindustries.net.  But don\'t worry -- we\'ll be reaching out to each and every customer individually before your shipment goes out, to confirm the details.  We don\'t want any Chromagnons lost in the mail!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biweekly schedule has been working well for the blog, so I will be sticking with that moving forward.  I\'m likely to issue more updates once we\'re past production/development goals and into a more promotional phase.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn totally unrelated news, I will be playing wargames at the fourth 3D Roleplay Con here in Portland over the weekend.  Please wish me many victories.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil next time I remain faithfully yours,\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"restocks-and-flight-checks","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/restocks-and-flight-checks","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-17-restocks-and-flight-checks/index.md","title":"Restocks & Flight Checks","description":"Hello, video pals!","date":"2024-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Chromagnon","permalink":"/blog/tags/chromagnon","description":"Posts about the Chromagnon video synthesizer"}],"readingTime":3.64,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Larsen","title":"Product Designer","url":"https://github.com/creatorlars","imageURL":"https://github.com/creatorlars.png","key":"lars","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"restocks-and-flight-checks","title":"Restocks & Flight Checks","authors":["lars"],"tags":["chromagnon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Prehistoric Plastic","permalink":"/blog/prehistoric-plastic"}},"content":"Hello, video pals!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are pushing through April! The current primary focus is on preparing our resource planning system for Chromagnon and smoothly flowing the production of our other projects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some photos of our inventory workspaces. We have accounted for hundreds of unique bin locations and over two million parts over the past few weeks. This primes our resource planning software to identify the quickest path solutions to keeping our manufacturing lean and effective with our small team.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./bins1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./bins2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./bins3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nLast week I printed revisions of the Chromagnon molded parts for test fit on our Formlabs printer, which is usually a joy to work with, but required some maintenance this time around. I\'ve been verifying test fits and getting quotes for various fabrication methods.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./print1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./print2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong other recent projects is a Mk2 revision of our TBC2 expander panel.  We lost our source for the SCART connectors used on the Mk1, 10HP version of this expander, so it has been revised to be 4HP with VGA connectors only. Those of you still waiting on your preorder of this module, or waiting for the firmware revision including all the VGA timing modes, will be served soon. Once we confirm the incoming design, we\'ll make it available for purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./expander.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also ordered an initial production run of 10 pcs our 6U EuroRack case with DC & sync distribution. If the fabricated pieces pass our QC, we should have these available for sale in May. I\'ve shown some teasers of the prototype before.  Here\'s what the production version looks like:\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nToday I am designing the Chromagnon rear panel and making revisions to the injection molded enclosure design. With those last pieces on order, my plate will be clear to focus on the Chromagnon firmware release and documentation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe changes in team composition I mentioned last update have slowed down our overall schedule with Chromagnon by another few weeks, compared to my plan to be shipping the first unit this month. There was, sadly, not much I could do about that, but the lag time is behind us now, and adjustments to our plans have been made. \\r\\n\\r\\nDave, the designer responsible for the Expedition, Castle and Orion series patch and sticker designs is working on a Chromagnon design currently! I look forward to showing that to you soon. We will, of course, be including this additional merch in all Chromagnon shipments.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther news: There has been a restock of merch items, cables, and alternate frontpanels on our webstore. Go check it out!\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are your questions since the last update:\\r\\n\\r\\n** Paul asked \\"Is it likely Chromagnon will ship this year?\\" **\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal we are fixated on right now is \\"Ship Unit #1.\\"  And we\'re within a few weeks of that goal. Will we be done fulfilling all orders by the end of the year?  I hope so, but that is the larger question.  After shipping the first unit we\'ll be fulfilling in batches that start small and then ramp up.  By the time we are shipping the first unit, everyone will know very specifically their spot in the batch allotments and a projected fulfillment date.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**On the forum, Boneoh asked \\"Is there something I can do to clamp the bright areas that allows adjustment? I can use Proc to decrease the brightness, but that scales the whole range down. It sounds simple, and I think I\u2019m missing something. Maybe a way using the Y value in Swatch?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nIt sounds like you want to adjust the gain of the brighter parts of the signal only, without effecting the darker or midtone values.  This kind of signal processing involves a non-linear transfer function of some kind.  There are several ways to approach it. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne way would be gamma curve adjustment using the logarithmic and exponential processors in DSG3.  By feeding luma video thru these processors you can compress the dark values (exponential curve) or you can compress the light values (logarithmic curve.)  Try this, and then mix the results with the original signal at varying proportions to dial it in the way you want.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother approach would be to use multiplexing (Switcher) and a comparator (Keychain) to change between two different processed signals, based on the grayscale level of the unprocessed source.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil next time; please keep your excellent questions coming!\\r\\nLars"}]}}')}}]);
