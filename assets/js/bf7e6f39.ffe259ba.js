Are you keeping track of the order dates coming from your dealers and are you going to ship them after you ship the orders you received directly? My concern is that I paid the total amount for the Chromagnon to the dealer, but if your dealer did not pay you that amount at the time you might be reluctant to sell it to them at the price I paid at the time (it was $799 if I remember correctly) as you have readjusted your cost estimates.. Thanks for taking the time to respond to my question!"'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Hi, Sebastien!  Dealers are required to place the order with us before offering a preorder.

You mentioned that Chromagnon\u2019s parameters can be directly modulated by audio signals without needing any sort of interface. What does this mean exactly? I can plug in audio through an AUX cord and have that influence the visuals on the Chromagnon?'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Hi Oli, thanks for the question.  It means exactly what you think -- you could take a line level audio signal coming out of a music player or other device and patch it directly into any of Chromagnon's 3.5mm input jacks.  This is a very direct form of audio modulation -- it will allow you to visualize the audio signal as it relates to the timing of the video display and itself becomes part of the video signal.  Frequencies near 120Hz, for example, when the video format has a 60Hz refresh rate, will show two waveforms across the screen.  When these external waveforms start mixing with Chromagnon's internal H and V ramp  generators, that's when things get more complex.  Realtime modulation and signal visualization are processes video synthesizers really excel at."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:'Oli also asked "What is an \u2018envelope follower\u2019 and what advantages does it have in this application?

Envelope followers allow you to modulate video parameters based on "how loud is the audio right now?", rather than "what does the audio waveform look like?".  The latter being what you get when you patch an audio signal in directly.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Thanks for reading, and I hope you are enjoying the Spring.\r\nLars"})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},28453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>i,x:()=>s});var n=o(96540);const a={},r=n.createContext(a);function i(e){const t=n.useContext(r);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function s(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:i(e.components),n.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}},65804:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/blog/spring-cleaning","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-31-spring-cleaning/index.md","title":"Spring Cleaning","description":"Hello, Chromagnonites and other video freaks.","date":"2024-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Chromagnon","permalink":"/blog/tags/chromagnon","description":"Posts about the Chromagnon video synthesizer"}],"readingTime":3.64,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Larsen","title":"Product Designer","url":"https://github.com/creatorlars","imageURL":"https://github.com/creatorlars.png","key":"lars","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"spring-cleaning","title":"Spring Cleaning","authors":["lars"],"tags":["chromagnon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Restocks & Flight Checks","permalink":"/blog/restocks-and-flight-checks"},"nextItem":{"title":"Marching Forward","permalink":"/blog/marching-forward"}}')}}]);
