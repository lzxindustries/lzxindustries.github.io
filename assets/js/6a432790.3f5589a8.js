To be clear and quite frank: I am deeply sorry for the wait, and I take full and unequivocal responsibility for it. I feel the sorriness of it deep in my bones each night as I'm trying fall asleep.  I feel it deep in my gut every time I pause to think about the number of artists who made a purchase with their budget for creative equipment they do not yet have in their hands.  This project has been the exact opposite of the scenario I wanted with LZX, and the biggest project planning/timing blunder I've ever made in my life.  I also feel quite guilty I can't just lock myself in a room 24/7 until it's done -- the business has to be run, kids have to eat, rent has to be paid, so products still have to be developed alongside.  I'm continuously rotating through projects, and moving Chromagnon forward with as many resources as I can give it.  I'm really looking forward to delivering on the promise of this device, and ending this chapter in our shared story.  Despite it all, thank you for believing in the dream of Chromagnon. You have all been very understanding and I owe you my gratitude.
