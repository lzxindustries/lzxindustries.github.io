Currently we do not have any active DIY designs in development, but there are some ideas on the backburner.  We are also offering our power and FPGA subassemblies via our webstore.  With some better documentation, I think these could be employed by DIY projects.  I think one of my interests here is to document some low parts count, single-supply designs that focus on really maximizing what you can do with ICs that are quite expensive, but make very low parts count implementations possible.  You are one of a few makers who really took off with the initial proposition of the Cadet series:  take these building blocks, and build on them.

Part of the issue is that even though we own the designs you're mentioning, we still have lots of parts cost and labor in assembling them -- everything is assembled with in house labor -- and any resources we have, we need to split across both Chromagnon and maintaining our existing modular lineup.  Right now we have a good strategy, I think, and it's mostly up to the strength of the overall synth market regarding our cashflow.  Sales of our existing modular catalog are the main push forward to getting the job done faster rather than later.
