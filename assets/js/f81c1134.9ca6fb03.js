We\'ve made a big progress push on Chromagnon with new PCB designs for subassemblies and their test boards, we\'ve got PRM kits in stock, and we\'ve published another round of content for our docs website. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe current political climate and new tariffs imposed on imports from China have us heavily concerned for everything we do here.  We received a tax bill in the past month that was several times higher than anything we\'ve seen before. Those of you who have been following our company for a while know that we follow a market price methodology to pricing our products, which means that what you pay for them is a direct product of the hard costs involved in parts and labor -- in other words, if the cost of the parts go up, the price will need to go up at some point as well.  We aren\'t there yet, as we\'re hoping the situation will change.  If you\'ve been looking at picking up some modules, it is a good time to get in before that happens.  We will honor all orders and backorders at the current pricing levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\'ve been following along with Chromagnon, we\'ve been pushing for over a year on a fully integrated single board solution designed to finalize the Chromagnon design so that it can enter production.  We\'ve been stuck at a stasis point on the next revision of that board for a few month, as you all are holding the line without much news.  I\'ve realized that the integrated single board approach has been holding us back from finalizing the design, and that the lost time in sealing the design is costing us more than time spent on alternative approaches -- such as the modular subassemblies we were working on earlier in the project.  We\'ve decided to pick up that thread and make a move toward a new version of the subassemblies, and integrating them into the next revision of the core.  This will ensure that we cut no corners when it comes to precision and stability, even though it will raise our production costs and labor when it comes time for production.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m happy to say that this effort has been a great success -- we\'ve designed, built and validated 5 different submodules and their test boards in the past month.  The test boards allow us to calibrate and test each submodule before installation on the main assembly. \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./chromagnon-subassemblies.jpg)\\r\\n*Modular subassemblies*\\r\\n\\r\\nPictured above you can see:\\r\\n- FQM-REVC, a quad multiplier submodule. This circuit is an enhanced derivative of the venerable MC1494 multiplier topology, optimized for video transmission and bandwidths.  It has individual trimming points for null, bias and gain. \\r\\n- DEC-REVA, a fully encapsulated decoder/encoder submodule designed to transform CVBS and Component video inputs into 1V RGB signals.\\r\\n- FWR-REVA, a quad rectifier submodule.  This circuit leverages the enhanced performance of our new P series rectifier, and will ensure that Chromagnon\'s shape generation functions do not produce distortions around the mirror thresholds of diamonds and other shapes.\\r\\n- FQA-REVA, a quad active attenuverter submodule.  This circuit is a revision of our classic null gap active video attenuverter design.  \\r\\n- HGA-REVA, a quad high gain clipping amp submodule.  The test board is shown, but the assemblies are missing in this photo.  This design provides high gain amplification of an input signal, with the integrated limiting amplifier clipping the outputs.  It has a few uses, but soft key generation is the most obvious one.  This is a new revision of circuits from Doorway, Staircase/Stairs, and Topogram. \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./fqm-revc.jpg)\\r\\n*A closer look at FQM-REVC*\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best part of these submodules testing well, is that we are much closer to done!! We have one more submodule design in progress, and then the next revision of the Chromagnon Core RevI can be completed -- with most of the circuitry moved to these submodules, the next Chromnagnon core board revision will go fast rather than being another tedious revision of a giant board.  I look forward to providing an update on that in the next update.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur content designers have been plowing through the massive amounts of documentation required for our new docs website, and we\'ve just published an update that includes baseline content for the remaining Gen3 modules without proper user manuals.  We\'ll be adding more illustrations and written content to this over time: https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/module-list\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter getting held up in customs, we finally have some kits in stock for our Precision Rectifier & Multipler (PRM) module.  This module is a basic ingredient of video synth functions, and the number of functions you can patch with it is a long list.  Read about them on the docs website here: https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/prm\\r\\n\\r\\nTimes are tough for the whole industry of USA based synth makers right now.

Following the release of this version, I expect to move into fulfillment plans and scheduling. I\'m currently weighing a few options which will have a big impact on how that all goes, and playing catch up on projects delayed in January and February.  The pace at which progress can be made with Chromagnon is set by the health of our sales and the synth industry in general, and this year has started roughly in that regard.  Despite that, I remain confident that LZX and Chromagnon will pull through strongly. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a year\'s hiatus, we released our first new module in November last year: PGO.  We now have five more in this series available, in what we are calling the P series: modules which fit one of the three themes: Passive, Precision or Programmable.  P Series functions are not complex, exciting video effects on an individual basis: they are the building blocks of them. Those of you who wish to dig into the nuts and bolts of analog graphics will find that all the right operators are here to patch most of the functions in our other modules.  As we consider revising earlier modules and developing  new modules, this series provides a chance to encapsulate our best practices in video synth module design thus far, and provide a solid foundation on which to do so.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./p-series-rack.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nPROGRAMMABLE\\r\\n\\r\\n- PGO: 4HP Programmable Gain & Offset\\r\\n- PAB: 4HP Programmable Active Buffers\\r\\n\\r\\nPRECISION\\r\\n\\r\\n- PRM: 4HP Precision Rectifier & Multiplier\\r\\n\\r\\nPASSIVE\\r\\n\\r\\n- MLT: 8HP Passive Multiples\\r\\n- LNK: 4HP Passive Links\\r\\n- P: 2HP Passive Potentiometer\\r\\n\\r\\nAll P Series modules are available in 3 variants:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Fully assembled, including any power cables\\r\\n- Full DIY kit, all parts included\\r\\n- Partial DIY kit, SMT assemblies and frontpanels only\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have stock of all variants available now, except PRM -- we\'ll have those added to stock soon.

Since I\'m aiming for this to be the production version, I\'m being careful to review every line item on the BOM against current supply chain availability, and find alternates for a few components that are more costly than they need to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring my firmware sprint in January, I wrote a desktop app which communicates over USB with our hardware, allowing remote settings editing and monitoring.  This is a big feature boost for Chromagnon, as it means I can enable user control over many advanced settings that aren\'t accessible via the frontpanel or Chromagnon\'s rear 16-position DIP switch.  I have been integrating the communications library into other projects as well, and the plan is to release the desktop application as a general purpose utility for interacting with all of the LZX embedded hardware in greater detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nJonah and I have also been wrapping up the details on a few new modules that have been in development, and trying to \\"close all our open tabs\\" in this regard.

I\'d also like to shout out Gary MacLeod, a community member who has helped immensely with solving issues with our website -- which now loads much faster, and has better product galleries.  We have Aaron Ross, a beloved community member and instructional designer, lined up to help with content editing and development too.  I\'m very grateful for the opportunity to work with these pros in a bartered exchange for modules -- as our budgets are quite slim going into Chromagnon season.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn parting, I received a note recently that expressed frustration over having not received an apology for the run-on-sentence that has been the Chromagon project timeline.  To be clear and quite frank: I am deeply sorry for the wait, and I take full and unequivocal responsibility for it. I feel the sorriness of it deep in my bones each night as I\'m trying fall asleep.  I feel it deep in my gut every time I pause to think about the number of artists who made a purchase with their budget for creative equipment they do not yet have in their hands.  This project has been the exact opposite of the scenario I wanted with LZX, and the biggest project planning/timing blunder I\'ve ever made in my life.  I also feel quite guilty I can\'t just lock myself in a room 24/7 until it\'s done -- the business has to be run, kids have to eat, rent has to be paid, so products still have to be developed alongside.  I\'m continuously rotating through projects, and moving Chromagnon forward with as many resources as I can give it.  I\'m really looking forward to delivering on the promise of this device, and ending this chapter in our shared story.  Despite it all, thank you for believing in the dream of Chromagnon. You have all been very understanding and I owe you my gratitude.

This assembly was designed to put all the remaining assembly work onto a single board, so that we could finally start shipping the project.  Our plans moved strongly thru the RevF review, but there were still several functional changes that needed to be made.  Then we got hit with the unexpected: sales slowed drastically this year, forcing us to downsize.   \\r\\n\\r\\nMoving into the Summer, we lost a few months of Chromagnon time scrambling to update processes and keep the business flowing.  By the end of the Summer, this task was done, and the second Chromagnon revision for the year was in review: RevG.  During the late Summer and into the Fall I wrote Chromagnon\'s firmware, as RevG was complete enough to write all the firmware functionality.  But there were still a few issues to resolve with the hardware, so in October I heavily into the RevH revisions.  With this revision, we also needed to integrate Chromagnon into our workflow outsourcing SMT assemblies.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe RevH order was sent in November, and review of the RevH prototype has been ongoing (and successful) since early December, with a couple of bumps in the road that required us to pick it up and put it back down a couple of times while waiting for parts. So, going well, but not going fast. The review is almost complete, and after it\'s done I\'ll make another blog post about what\'s next. We are close to our \\"ship unit one\\" milestone, which is when a complete hardware unit goes to a beta tester. That might be RevH, or it may be RevI -- not positive yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./chromagnon-revh.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat else did we do in 2024?  We launched our new 6U case design, and our first packaged system: Double Vision.   We also released the utility module PGO, and we said goodbye to Vidiot, with a limited run of 24 units using our remaining stock of enclosures.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat else will we do in 2025?  We have a few new module designs nearing readiness we are excited to introduce.

We have also used PGO to prototype a more complete approach to our product documentation, and you can see what that looks like here at https://docs.lzxindustries.net/docs/modules/pgo.  P Series can be considered the successor to Cadet series, as well as Expedition modules providing raw functions, such as Bridge and Arch. We have a few more planned, and we\'ll release them over the upcoming months. \\r\\n\\r\\nPGO may not appeal to every video synthesist -- it is a raw function, and is the kind of module you can use as a building block in patching more complex custom functions. For myself, I\'m very excitd to have 16 of them in their own rack, and using that rack for future development ideas.  For existing Gen3 owners, you could use it this way -- or in a few other contexts as well.  Check out the docs linked above for more on that topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other news, we have a few new variations for the Double Vision System available.  The first is the option to purchase Double Vision with our 168HP modular case, allowing 84HP of empty space to grow into.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./double-vision-system-6u.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second is an expanded Double Vision system including 168HP of Gen3 modules.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./double-vision-system-168.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third is an expander for existing Double Vision owners, allowing you to upgrade your existing Double Vision to the 168HP and 84HP of new modules.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./double-vision-expander-168.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have stock of these variants available now. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s answer your questions!\\r\\n\\r\\n*Van Ta asked, \\"Those 4Q multiplier submodules from the last entry look really exciting. Are you planning to sell them as well for DIYers?\\"*\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'d like to!  I\'m not sure what form that will take yet, in light of the P Series DIY modules, and our next development plans. The next P Series module is a programmable comparator, switch, and multiplier combo function. Since it is a 4HP module, I\'m going with an IC based multiplier for the first prototype. The discrete cell designs are probably most practical in the context of a DIY rotator or matrix multiplier module. If I don\'t do something specific with the boards I developed, I will consider releasing the designs so others can dig in.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Asjave asked, \\"Does the Double Vision system have everything in the Chromagnon and more, or are there features in Chromagnon that don\'t exist in the Double-Vision system? Thank you!\\"*\\r\\n\\r\\nDouble Vision and Chromagnon are entirely different video synthesizers, with different internal functions.  They are similar in that they can both process an SD/HD analog video signal, and perform various shape generation, pattern synthesis, feedback, and colorization effects.  But the specifics are quite different.  The biggest functional add for Double Vision is its open ended patchability and being able to mix and process two external video sources.  You could consider Chromagnon a *video processor*, and Double Vision a *video mixer.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*Sig asked, \\"Any chance the new TBC2 VGA expander comes with an EDID chip? If not, would you consider this for a future version? I think it would be a really nice feature.\\"*\\r\\n\\r\\nHi Sig, no -- the VGA expander doesn\'t have an EDID chip, but that is an interesting proposal.  In its current architecture, TBC2 is designed to auto-detect the incoming video format and, if supported, lock to it. An EDID chip would allow the transmitting device to read the supported input formats and present those as valid options to the user.  Since you can see the supported TBC2 input formats in our documentation, you should be able to configure your device appropriately as it is -- but I can understand why the EDID chip would be a nice thing to have. \\r\\n\\r\\n*Pat said, \\"Hi! I just finished reading the latest monthly journal entry (November). It sounds like you guys are making some great progress but I\'m a little confused with all the technical talk and where Chromagnon sits along the timeline of being finished. Would it be possible to include some type of metric in each post for the layman? Say, like a percentage of completion where 100% means the unit is ready to ship? I appreciate all the details but it\'s hard for me to figure out what it all means in the big picture.\\"*\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand -- I appreciate that the jargon may be frustrating to read when you are looking for an answer to a simple question. At the beginning of the year on January 5th\'s blog, I outlined 3 milestones to completing this project:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Production ready\\r\\n- Ship unit one\\r\\n- Ship all pre-orders\\r\\n\\r\\nSince there are so many moving pieces involved in the project, it would be difficult to quantify *percentage complete* in terms of the overall ongoing project.  For example, most of the production work is already done, since Chromagnon\'s control board assembly went into production back in 2021-2022. Going into this year, the \\"Production ready\\" milestone includes finalizing parts design, PCB design, and firmware.  Compared to where we were in January, parts design is 100% done, PCB design is *pending* 100% done, and firmware is 95% done.  We were at this state back in August too, but the most recent PCB design needed more work, and it took a few weeks to make that revision.  So in other words, *if* no more hardware revisions are neccessary on this incoming prototype -- we will be moving past the Production ready milestone finally, before the end of the year.  The leap from Production Ready to Ship Unit One is not so big, and much easier to estimate. It will happen right after production ready, as most of the tasks involved in prepping for that next milestone have already been completed.  I hope this helps you understand better where we are with the project. \\r\\n\\r\\n*Dan asked, \\"Do you think Chromagnon will be shipping by Christmas 2024?\\"*\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is quite possible we will reach the Ship Unit One milestone (see above reply to Pat) before the end of the year.

I\'m happy to say that the board is now ordered, but with a few weeks of hassle -- both in the revision process, and the coordination process with our external vendor.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./fqm-submodule-revb.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n*A discrete quad multiplier subassembly and testing jig*\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter racing between various solutions, I was able to settle on one that did not require submodules at all, in order to fit the full circuit onto the existing assembly -- which is a good thing, for Chromagnon.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./chromagnon-core-revh-render.png)\\r\\n*Chromagnon Core RevH*\\r\\n\\r\\nThe board\'s BOM is so big it was causing issues with the vendor\'s system initially -- thankfully they were able to resolve that, but it cost us over a week.  I wanted to hit this milestone before publishing a new blog.  It\'s nice to be writing this one knowing that assembly is underway, and that I\'ll be able to begin testing RevH immediately when it arrives in the latter half of November.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being behind where I wanted to be at the end of October, this milestone is quite exciting.  With the off site assembly process flowing smoothly, we have the stage set for formal production when it is go time.   I look forward to writing another update about Chromagnon toward the end of the month.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other news, in the time in between Chromagnon tasks, I have been working on our new documentation website at https://docs.lzxindustries.net.  You may be there already, as it is the new location for this blog.  Most of the content is hidden from public view for now, but I\'m quite happy with how the illustration and writing process is going so far.  We\'ll be migrating most content from our current website to this new static site soon -- including all module documentation, resources and articles. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, here\'s a teaser of a new module we have been working on. It will be available as a DIY project as well as assembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./pgo-rgb.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'ll tell you more about it and more about the docs site in the next update.  I have a little over a week before my Chromagnon board arrives, to make some progress in these areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther news: more Double Vision systems are being built this month and are available to order now.

Rather than sending them to the junk, we\'ve been making progress over the Sumer on building up a limited batch of 24 units using those parts.  You can order one now at https://lzxindustries.net/products/vidiot\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./vidiot.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'ve made some revisions to our Double Vision system bundle -- including a full 3U EuroRack enclosure using our new sync and power distribution board architecture.  This version also includes the TBC2 expander, in lieu a DC Distro.  We have a couple systems in stock right now for purchse: at https://lzxindustries.net/products/double-vision-system\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./double-vision.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Chromagnon front, I have been laser focused (pun intended) on preparing the hardware for production.  After this last prototype review, the full context is a lot easier to see, including the remaining steps needed until we\'re actually placing the order for production core boards and molded parts. This process has been grueling, as the core board\'s BOM and parts count are massive. Thus, I\'ve been breaking some repetitive parts of the analog circuit into submodules. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of those submodules is a four quadrant multiplier sub-assembly that encapsulates our discrete design. This design is based on topologies in classic multiplier ICs such as MC1494 and MC1495, which are long obsolete.  A core requirement of the Chromagnon design is the implementation of this discrete multiplier, as there are over 20 of them in its analog circuit!  We\'ve been working on this circuit since before Chromagnon was even conceived, and after so many revisions I\'m very pleased with how it is performing.  Here\'s a look at the submodule.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./submodule.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis submodule is being reintegrated into Chromagnon\'s core board, which reduces the BOM count by a few hundred parts and will allow pre-testing/calibration of the analog circuit. We have already received our initial order of these submodules and are testing them now. \\r\\n\\r\\nRevisions to Chromagnon Core RevH will be ordered by the end of this week.  I\'m not used to spending entire weeks on a single PCB layout, so that gives you an idea of the scale of the effort required to push this forward. This is the first version of the board that is being 100% assembled out of our workshop, which means we\'re priming it to be ready to go, and it is a candidate for production.  I\'d love to have it all confirmed and initial quantities ordered by the end of October -- there\'s not a lot left to stand in our way of that happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, here are answers to the questions you have submitted since the last update:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Marty asked, \\"Looking forward to shipping on Chromagnon. Well done on all the work so far. When shipping does occur. Will the cost of the unit, detailed for customs. Reflect the date of purchase or current value? I\'m just worried about the extra tax I\'m going to pay when it ships to Australia.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi, Marty. The customs info will reflect the price you paid on your original sales invoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pat asked, \\"Can we expect Chromagnon unit #1 to ship out by Halloween?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably not, Pat!  In the next Chromagnon milestone, I\'m hoping to be telling you we\'ve got RevH confirmed and have ordered initial production parts. That is getting very close, and would mean we have unit #1 here. Whether or not it\'s shipping by that date, I don\'t know -- firmware is about 95% done, but there\'s still a few items to wrap up and test once the hardware is sealed.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Paul asked, \\"Would it be possible to demonstrate through your LZX documentation learning program, the placement and attachment of modules into a Vessel or eurorack case? And if any modules have to be linked together or sync. This is for those who don\u2019t know. Thank you.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi Paul. Yes, certainly! We do have a basic guide to doing this on our website at https://lzxindustries.net/getting-started.

Unlike software based visual generators, or simpler analog circuits (like our modules), Chromagnon is a design that has been very difficult to show as a work in progress until all of the pieces, both hardware and firmware, were in play.  I am very glad to be at this point, because you\'ll no longer have to take my word for it when it comes to what, how, and why Chromagnon does what it does.\\r\\n\\r\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhlNyixE1vo?si=Vl5htKHzqpl1NEQK\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./testing.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nTesting in progress.

Glad to hear your progress update, it must feel pretty good to get out of the cave and into the light!  I\'m curious as to what h/w you have chosen for the Chromagnon. I\'m interested in FPGAs and have ordered a Zybo board to experiment with.\\" **\\r\\n\\r\\nPete, thanks for writing!  Chromagnon\'s hardware is quite intensive.  At it\'s core, it is an analog synthesizer with a fully analog, wideband signal path -- but also, there is a complex digital embedded system which handles the user interface, video input decoding and scaling (SD to HD and HD to SD), and 10-bit ramp waveform generation. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the digital system, we are using a System-on-Module from MYiR, which you can read more about here. This is based on the Xilinx Zynq system on chip -- the same as employed on your Zybo board.  Xilinx FPGAs are used heavily in broadcast and imaging applications of all kinds. On our host board, we use video encoding and decoding interface ICs such as the ADV7181C, ADV7123 and ADV7125 for interfacing analog video with the Zynq IO ports. I hope you have fun with the Zybo board!\\r\\n\\r\\nTalk to you again soon,\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"code-cave","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/code-cave","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-08-code-cave/index.md","title":"Code Cave","description":"Over the past several weeks I have been writing Chromagnon\u2019s firmware, and I\u2019m happy to say that I now have a complete version ready for testing.

Approaching these instruments, I had many firmware and software projects behind me \u2013 but none at this level of structural complexity.  So I was surprised by the scale of what I still needed to learn with regards to architectural patterns and systems level design. Hardware scales easily \u2013 five circuits is five circuits \u2013 but in software, writing a state control system for five asynchronous modules is a different beast entirely.  The experience has definitely kindled a love for embedded development with modern C++ in general, and I look forward to doing more of it. During the past few weeks of getting cozy with Chromagnon\u2019s digital brain, I felt both confident and effective, and that was a relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\u2019s next? With firmware in place, we are able to move into a new verification process for the instrument as a whole.  That\u2019s a long list of tests, including nearly 200 different video input conversion modes \u2013 in addition to all combinations of Chromagnon\u2019s 12 compositor modes, 3 chroma modes, 3 luma modes, and 4 primary modes. Most of this testing has already been done with prior versions of the hardware, but we still need to repeat the tests now that we have a firmware candidate. In the next blog, I\u2019ll describe how that\u2019s going.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other news, we have added the DIY kit version of our power & sync distribution busboard to the webstore.  Check that out here.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./sync.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also have a restock of Scrolls hitting the shelf. While I have not had time to film it yet, here is a script for a video about Scrolls that you may read. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Summer sale is active, with discounts offered on Sum/Dist, Contour and Matte modules. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'re still taking orders for Double Vision systems. It has been exciting to watch new video artists dig into the depths of their systems over the Summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are your questions, since the last post.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Luis asked, \\"Are there any plans to further improve the Memory Palace firmware?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nMemory Palace Mk2 will be a follow-up project after Chromagnon. The first phase of that project will include some revisions to the existing Mk1 firmware, as our plan is to support concurrent versions. The main difference being that Mk2 will support HD modes. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Mat asked, \\"Just curious about the timeframe in regards to the Double Vision preorder. Will there be a long wait? I just ordered recently and will hopefully not have to wait as long as I have for the Chromagnon.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we launched the Double Vision system bundle, the average wait time for a shipment has been about 3 weeks.  I expect that to stay consistent.  We have a good flow coming thru the workshop of stocking the module sets in small batches. Your Double Vision is actually in QC today, and planning to ship tomorrow.  You sent in this question on July 15th, so that seems pretty consistent with the average lead time.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Thomas asked, \\"Are preorders for the Chromagnon still open? Nothing happens when I press the preorder button, and I see people selling their preorder slots online.  Am I too late to buy one?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nPreorders are open. If you click the preorder button on the product page, you should see it added to your shopping cart (but the site doesn\'t automatically take you there.)  This is not a limited edition -- the date we have Chromagnons in stock and all preorders are fulfilled is still uncertain, but you don\'t need to worry about missing out.  We hope to keep the instrument in production for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Patrick said, \\"It seems like a lot is happening over there right now, and there are many updates and things to discuss in each monthly journal post. Is there any inclination to get back to doing a weekly journal post to keep us more in the loop? Or would that slow production down because it\'s another thing to think about? Either way, I\'m glad Chromagnon is still being worked on. Since June has come and gone, is there any new estimate for when the first unit might ship out?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nPatrick, I\'m sorry the updates have been less frequent.  Currently the core team is down to myself full time and three part timers.  Writing these blog posts is no huge burden, but it does take 2-3 hours out of my work week each time. With hardware development and workshop projects, tasks are shorter -- 1 to 16 hrs each -- to do a board layout, or revision, or build a prototype.  With software or circuit design it\'s often 3-6 week sprints, during which it can be difficult for me to do anything but write code or run simulations.  With code sprints in the rear window for now, I\'ll try to up the pace of the updates.  I\'m hoping to be past hardware verification and on to production and user docs soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Kazys asked, \\"How effective is Chromagnon with a Vectrex? Can it do Rutt-Etra style rescanning into X / Y / Z out of the box?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have not recorded any Vectrex monitor tests yet, and that should be the final judge of this -- but you\'ve got the right idea. The scaler decimation settings allow you to output low frequency rasters for lower bandwidth displays, like laser projectors and the Vectrex. I expect some of the middle settings to be right for use with the Vectrex -- a raster size of 120x68, for example.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Kazys also asked, \\"If I have a Chromagnon, why would I need an ESG3? Is it still useful?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely. Chromagnon has no dedicated RGB level or offset controls, so ESG3 would add a lot, with each of ESG3\'s six knobs and three switches representing parameters not present on Chromagnon.  Another reason to have an ESG3 is if you are using Chromagnon in the context of a modular system, and want to mix it\'s output with other sources before the final output. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have questions about hardware development, software development, LZX, or you just need someone to talk to, write to me here:  https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA\\r\\n\\r\\n- Lars"},{"id":"summer-crunch","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/summer-crunch","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-29-summer-crunch/index.md","title":"Summer Crunch","description":"Dear video friends,","date":"2024-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Chromagnon","permalink":"/blog/tags/chromagnon","description":"Posts about the Chromagnon video synthesizer"}],"readingTime":5.64,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Larsen","title":"Product Designer","url":"https://github.com/creatorlars","imageURL":"https://github.com/creatorlars.png","key":"lars","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"summer-crunch","title":"Summer Crunch","authors":["lars"],"tags":["chromagnon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Code Cave","permalink":"/blog/code-cave"},"nextItem":{"title":"Chromagnon Box","permalink":"/blog/chromagnon-box"}},"content":"Dear video friends, \\r\\n\\r\\nJune has seen a lot of projects landing at the workshop and some significant pushes in firmware development. Over the Spring we have transitioned into outsourcing SMT assembly of our modules in smaller batches, in an effort to keep things stocked and flowing, and those efforts are running smoothly. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Summer is traditionally a period of low sales for us, so we have decided to open a sale for some modules we have lots of stock of. You will find Contour, Matte, and Sum/Dist have been marked down 25%, for the time being, on our webstore. If you\'ve been wanting to pick one of these up, now is a good time to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a summary of notable recent milestones:\\r\\n\\r\\nTBC2 1.0.3 firmware was released.  This includes better support for the VGA input expander and the addition of a 240p input mode.  So pull out your SNES and Chrono Trigger cartridge if you want to travel thru time, saving the world from Lavos, while also traveling thru your analog video circuits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you had an outstanding order for the TBC2 VGA input expander module, it has been shipped.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now stocking fan upgrade kits for TBC2 Mk1 & Mk2 on our webstore.  If you already ordered the Mk1 (Orion style) kits from us, we neglected to send mounting screws in the first few shipments -- but the screws have already been mailed to you in a separate package this week.  So look out for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMemory Palace 2.0.2 firmware was released.  This is a maintenance release which includes a screensaver function to prevent burn-in on your OLED screen in the case that you are logging lots of hours on your device. \\r\\n\\r\\nTBC2\'s video engine firmware has been ported to Chromagnon and is running on the new RevG PCB assembly.  I\'ve put a lot of time into merging work from TBC2 into a common library that is now shared with Chromagnon, to ensure consistent performance across both devices.  This will also set the stage for Memory Palace Mk2 revisions, which will be the big project after Chromagnon development has wrapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis past week I have written a parameter state engine, with auto recovery from loss of power or corrupted backups, to use across our firmware for various modules.  This will ensure that Chromagnon boots back up in the same state in which it was powered down. We\'ll be able to integrate that functionality into the next firmware release for TBC2 as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nEntering July, I am still investing most of my time into Chromagnon firmware and hardware review.  This includes writing tests for validating the control assemblies we\'ve already built and the RevG hardware.  Currently I am improving the software that allows for firmware update from MicroSD card, since with Chromagnon it needs to run in a headless manner. (Unlike TBC2 and Memory Palace, which both used OLED screens and keypads.) \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./thermal-camera.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n*Chromagnon RevG under the thermal camera!*\\r\\n\\r\\nA few background projects landed in June as well, including some parts we will use to revise the Cadet DIY series.  This maintenance revision will be ongoing for a few months, and will bring the core DIY modules up to spec for HD video synthesis timing, and offer some new supply chain/build options for hard to source components.  Once these revisions are complete, we\'ll offer the PCB and frontpanel sets again via our webstore.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./thonk-cadets.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOur order from Thonk for parts to use in building Cadet revisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our ongoing initiative to offer a line of professional enclosures for our modules, the pieces for a 3U variant of our 6U rackmount case have arrived.  These will be an upgrade option for your Double Vision system, and we\'ll soon offer a version of the Double Vision system which uses this case.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case-3u.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n3U variant of our powered EuroRack case for video synthesizers\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, a kit variant of our 10 amp DC power and sync distribution bus has arrived, for DIY installations into other cases. This version includes a chassis-mounted DC input jack and screw terminals on the PCB.  The busboard is equivalent to three times the amount of power and number of connectors as our 4HP DC distro module, and it will be suitable for powering cases of Gen3 modules over 252HP.   Look for this on our webstore in July.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext case projects will include a portable variant with a lid, and a legacy power supply expander for the 6U and portable cases.  The legacy power supply expander will be perfect for powering audio modules or older generations of LZX modules using the new Vessel cases.  I\'m excited to have a case that works with everything.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pat asked \\"The prototypes for the plastic pieces and enclosure look great! I\u2019m stoked that you guys have come this far with the project!. A few weeks ago you said you are hoping to ship unit one in June, is that still the plan?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi, Pat. Thanks!! We are getting close to that point. The Summer slump I mentioned slowed us down slightly -- and I squeezed in the TBC2 and Memory Palace updates that folks have been waiting on for a while, which delayed us as well. With the firmware project above wrapped up, we will be close to shipping the first unit.  Then we can roll up our sleeves and get our headspace shifted into rolling into a rhythm with the remaining Chromagnon production, documentation, and fulfillment.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Yuya said \\"Thank you so much to Lars and all of you who continue to work hard every day towards the launch of Chromagnon! I love Memory Palace. Luckily my Memory Palace display hasn\'t burned in yet, but I\'m super nervous about it happening... Are there plans to release a new firmware that implements a screensaver like TBC2? Also, are there any plans to release a fan upgrade kit like TBC2? Thank you again!\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHello, Yuya. Thank you so much for your enthusiasm and support.  It is a relief on my stress levels and a boon to the projects we are working on to hear from you all like this.  As you can read above, the Memory Palace firmware update should help with your concerns about screen burn in.  I will definitely add a fan upgrade kit for Memory Palace to our project queue, now that TBC2 kits are out the door. \\r\\n\\r\\nGot more questions, suggestions, comments or high fives?

The pieces below aren\'t final for the enclosure, but should give you the plan on how it all fits together.  Now that all the dimensional constraints are confirmed, I can make any cosmetic tweaks (rounded corners, for example) and order an initial production quantity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./chromag1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./chromag2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nLast week, we finally got the RevG core board built up. This week, I\'m running through my checklist of revision items to make sure that everything that was corrected from RevF is now functioning as intended.  \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./chromag3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we move into June, there are three main objectives on my plate:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Purchase an initial quantity of plastic parts and backlit film inserts for the LED grid. This will probably be 5-10 sets to start, and then we will ramp up if everything is going smoothly.\\r\\n2) Finalize the testing platform for the existing Chromagnon control boards, and get an initial quantity of the existing control assemblies through testing.\\r\\n3) Release V1.0 of the firmware, which still needs a few utility functions such as user firmware update procedure and some hardware self tests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will all lead up to our \\"ship unit one\\" goal.  Once we hit that, we can transition into Chromagnon documentation, promotion, and ongoing production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for being patient with me.  As I have brought up in the last couple posts, our team has downsized significantly since the beginning of the year -- this has pushed a large number of new tasks onto my plate personally, which has meant my time is split across Chromagnon, shipping, purchasing and managing ongoing production.  On one hand this has been intense, but on the other, the company is more stable and I feel like we are in better control of our path moving forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\'s a preview of the new Chromagnon patch design.  What do you think?\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./patch.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, here are your questions since the last update.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeffrey asked, \\"Will the Chromagon make the Cyclops obsolete? If not, in what ways will the Cyclops still be relevant?\ufeff\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChromagnon is not a direct replacement for Cyclops. Chromagnon is an integrated color vector and video processor with ILDA input and output.  Cyclops is an ILDA output module for EuroRack synthesizers. One way you could use them together is to use Cyclops to create patterns from your EuroRack synthesizer, and then use Chromagnon as a post-processor for the resulting patterns, between your EuroRack and your laser.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Rogers asked, \\"Will LZX be embracing generative AI, and implementing it into to a module?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInteresting question.  As a company dedicated to the longevity of analog and embedded hardware technology, any attempt to integrate Stable Diffusion algorithms, or generative models, into our gear would manifest as a program for one of our FPGA platforms like TBC2 or Memory Palace.  In a way, I feel like the tactile nature of analog feedback, and processing in general, is a different kind of generative intelligence and provides a necessary counterpoint to our culture\'s current obsession with generative algorithms and models.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn any case, I\'m quite content focusing mostly on analog and partially on embedded digital for the foreseeable future. There are still countless ideas in this area that I would like for LZX to explore.  It is likely that we will develop new solutions for interfacing the analog worlds with the software worlds more seamlessly, rather than developing a generative AI product.\\r\\n\\r\\nDream Taser said, \\"Hi Lars! The Chromagnon updates are brontosaurus burgers for a hungry caveman! Much appreciated! I wanted to suggest something for the artwork\u2026 cavemen projecting torchlight on cave wall, perhaps some animated animals and something to do with northern lights \ud83d\ude01\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrilliant ideas! I love the idea of cave paintings in torchlight. Beneath Chromagnon\'s cheeky persona, this idea is part of the instrumentation concept -- a connection to something primal and prehistoric. I hope Chromagnon taps into the firestarter and toolholder instincts in every human operator\'s brain, and that they feel personally connected to the visual results.  The initial visual metaphor I have had in my head from the beginning is the \\"primordial pool\\" -- a swirling, rotating mass of colors and ingredients. \\r\\n\\r\\nGot more questions?

I am very happy with the fit and look of these components and feel like they add a lot to Chromagnon\'s personality. \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./chromag.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso arriving since my last post is Chromagnon\'s back panel PCB, which is where Chromagnon\'s cooling fan will mount.  I have a few adjustments to make on this part, but otherwise it looks nice.  The only remaining part of the assembly is the enclosure/shell piece -- I should be able to show that to you soon.  With all of those designs sealed, we will finally have the complete recipe card for this prehistoric video synthesizer. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, on the Chromagnon front, I have been reviewing our inventory of Chromagnon control assemblies. We have several hundred of these built, but they need functional testing. So we built a test wiring harness and embedded system to speed up that process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modular news, we received our production parts for the new case, now officially titled Vessel 168.  I\'m so excited about how good the matte black powder coating looks on the sheet metal, and on the fit of all the components.  We\'ll have an initial batch of these up for sale in a few days. This initial offering is rack mountable, and includes a central DC & Sync distribution bus, with 28 DC power jack outputs and 14 buffered sync outputs (with a single sync input).\\r\\n\\r\\nComing next for the case will be variants for 3U, the much requested briefcase version with lid and carrying handle, and a EuroRack power supply expander for powering your legacy modules.  Please let us know if you have any suggestions on what products you\'d like to see in our catalog for case and case expander variations.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn TBC2 news, after much research and testing, we have made an ultra silent fan upgrade kit with installation instructions for the Gen3 (Mk2) and are currently making a similar kit for the Orion (Mk1) units.  Once we have both of those in stock, we\'ll have them available on the website. The fans in use on TBC2 have had a variable range of loudness, with some fans being annoying to some users.  The fans we used were initially designed for 3D printers, where noise is not a big concern -- so it\'s taken us a while to find fans in the right form factor which are also dead silent.  Also, the TBC2 Expander Mk2 I previewed in the last blog has been prototyped and looks great, so we are in the middle of building a batch.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, on to your questions:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pat asked \\"Are you really a few weeks away from shipping the first Chromagnon unit? How many weeks if you had to guess?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nA better way to phrase that statement would have been \\"we are about 2 months behind the schedule we made back in December when the blog started.\\" That schedule was looking to ship a first unit in April, so that would mean I am now hoping to be doing so by the end of June.  It\'s looking good that all the production related deliverables will get wrapped up this month (the final enclosure design is the biggest piece missing).  How fast we roll out production from that point, is still unknown -- but we are making steady forward progress.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Michael asked \\"Do you know when the Proc might be reproduced? I have an order for it with Perfect Circuit but I don\u2019t know if I should wait on that or, if it\u2019s going to be on the other side of the Chromagnon stuff, just try and find one / something else on the used market. \\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have Proc in stock here at LZX -- if Perfect Circuit don\'t have stock, they can place an order with us at any time.  It could be that they recently received a shipment from us, but have not put it into inventory yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n**heavy light asked \\"I realise the team  are busy building /designing modules and all that but when are we getting some new t shirts ?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nMy comrade, there is a new shirt / patch / sticker design for Chromagnon in progress right now.  Dave, who designed the Vidiot & Chromagnon characters is working on it. Please always let us know if you have suggestions for what merch or merch designs you want to see.  We love showing our personalities as designers in ways that extend beyond the products themselves. Since we were all in many bands at various points, merch is a big part of that!\\r\\n\\r\\n**Aaron asked \\"Hi! I want to update my shipping address before you start sending out units; how can I do that?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can update the shipping address for your order at any time by writing to sales@lzxindustries.net.  But don\'t worry -- we\'ll be reaching out to each and every customer individually before your shipment goes out, to confirm the details.  We don\'t want any Chromagnons lost in the mail!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biweekly schedule has been working well for the blog, so I will be sticking with that moving forward.  I\'m likely to issue more updates once we\'re past production/development goals and into a more promotional phase.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn totally unrelated news, I will be playing wargames at the fourth 3D Roleplay Con here in Portland over the weekend.

Will we be done fulfilling all orders by the end of the year?  I hope so, but that is the larger question.  After shipping the first unit we\'ll be fulfilling in batches that start small and then ramp up.  By the time we are shipping the first unit, everyone will know very specifically their spot in the batch allotments and a projected fulfillment date.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**On the forum, Boneoh asked \\"Is there something I can do to clamp the bright areas that allows adjustment? I can use Proc to decrease the brightness, but that scales the whole range down. It sounds simple, and I think I\u2019m missing something. Maybe a way using the Y value in Swatch?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nIt sounds like you want to adjust the gain of the brighter parts of the signal only, without effecting the darker or midtone values.  This kind of signal processing involves a non-linear transfer function of some kind.  There are several ways to approach it. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne way would be gamma curve adjustment using the logarithmic and exponential processors in DSG3.  By feeding luma video thru these processors you can compress the dark values (exponential curve) or you can compress the light values (logarithmic curve.)  Try this, and then mix the results with the original signal at varying proportions to dial it in the way you want.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother approach would be to use multiplexing (Switcher) and a comparator (Keychain) to change between two different processed signals, based on the grayscale level of the unprocessed source.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil next time; please keep your excellent questions coming!\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"spring-cleaning","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/spring-cleaning","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-31-spring-cleaning/index.md","title":"Spring Cleaning","description":"Hello, Chromagnonites and other video freaks.","date":"2024-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Chromagnon","permalink":"/blog/tags/chromagnon","description":"Posts about the Chromagnon video synthesizer"}],"readingTime":3.675,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Larsen","title":"Product Designer","url":"https://github.com/creatorlars","imageURL":"https://github.com/creatorlars.png","key":"lars","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"spring-cleaning","title":"Spring Cleaning","authors":["lars"],"tags":["chromagnon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Restocks & Flight Checks","permalink":"/blog/restocks-and-flight-checks"},"nextItem":{"title":"Marching Forward","permalink":"/blog/marching-forward"}},"content":"Hello, Chromagnonites and other video freaks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch has flown past here at headquarters. The last 3 weeks have been dedicated to a spring cleaning of the workspace and an inventory data update, in preparation for Chromagnon and continuing module production.

Ensuring we\'re ready for that stage is exciting and it\'s all coming together nicely.  We have several different strategies for production: full assembly in house, contracted manufacturing, or both in different stages.  I have quotes out with multiple potential manufacturing partners, and we are setting our resource planning system up to manage consigning some of the parts we have in stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chromagnon Core RevG PCBs have arrived and we\'ll be assembling one of those next week. The EuroRack case project prototype tests have gone well and we\'ll be ordering another round of prototypes next week, as well.

Are you keeping track of the order dates coming from your dealers and are you going to ship them after you ship the orders you received directly? My concern is that I paid the total amount for the Chromagnon to the dealer, but if your dealer did not pay you that amount at the time you might be reluctant to sell it to them at the price I paid at the time (it was $799 if I remember correctly) as you have readjusted your cost estimates.. Thanks for taking the time to respond to my question!\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi, Sebastien!  Dealers are required to place the order with us before offering a preorder.  We will fulfill all orders in exactly the same order they arrived, regardless of whether the order came from a dealer or a direct customer on our webstore.  So everything should be OK with your order as it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Oli asked \\"Hi, synth noob here. You mentioned that Chromagnon\u2019s parameters can be directly modulated by audio signals without needing any sort of interface. What does this mean exactly? I can plug in audio through an AUX cord and have that influence the visuals on the Chromagnon?**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi Oli, thanks for the question.  It means exactly what you think -- you could take a line level audio signal coming out of a music player or other device and patch it directly into any of Chromagnon\'s 3.5mm input jacks.  This is a very direct form of audio modulation -- it will allow you to visualize the audio signal as it relates to the timing of the video display and itself becomes part of the video signal.  Frequencies near 120Hz, for example, when the video format has a 60Hz refresh rate, will show two waveforms across the screen.  When these external waveforms start mixing with Chromagnon\'s internal H and V ramp  generators, that\'s when things get more complex.  Realtime modulation and signal visualization are processes video synthesizers really excel at.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Oli also asked \\"What is an \u2018envelope follower\u2019 and what advantages does it have in this application? Really excited to have audio visual reactivity and involved in my process :)\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nAn envelope follower is a circuit that you would put between an audio source (like line out from a music player) and a modulation input in your video synthesizer (like the threshold of a wipe generator.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe envelope follower\'s job is to follow the amplitude peaks of the incoming waveform and average them out at a slow time constant near video frame rate.   Envelope followers allow you to modulate video parameters based on \\"how loud is the audio right now?\\", rather than \\"what does the audio waveform look like?\\".  The latter being what you get when you patch an audio signal in directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for reading, and I hope you are enjoying the Spring.\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"marching-forward","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/marching-forward","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-11-marching-forward/index.md","title":"Marching Forward","description":"Hello everyone,","date":"2024-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Chromagnon","permalink":"/blog/tags/chromagnon","description":"Posts about the Chromagnon video synthesizer"}],"readingTime":6.59,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Larsen","title":"Product Designer","url":"https://github.com/creatorlars","imageURL":"https://github.com/creatorlars.png","key":"lars","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"marching-forward","title":"Marching Forward","authors":["lars"],"tags":["chromagnon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Spring Cleaning","permalink":"/blog/spring-cleaning"},"nextItem":{"title":"Double Visions","permalink":"/blog/double-visions"}},"content":"Hello everyone,\\r\\n\\r\\nI apologize that we missed last week\'s update.

While we still need to validate that the revisions are good to go (a first article test) before production, this means design of Chromagnon\'s electronics is finally complete, and I can move on to details related to the enclosure and control knob mold -- as well as polishing the firmware and making more docs and videos for you.\\r\\n- Prototype pieces for our new EuroRack enclosure arrived, and we had some successful testing of our new DC Power & Sync distribution busboard. Unfortunately one of the case pieces arrived from the fabricator warped -- they\'ve refunded us but that\'s why you can see some gaps and imperfections in the below photo.  Everything else looks good though and we\'ll be ordering a small quantity of cases for production this month.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./case.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./busboard.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Derek asked \\"When will LZX hire a full time firmware coder? Lars you are one person, and you can only do so much while so many wait for overdue firmware revisions while you are stretched thin over so many projects. Learning how to let go, and delegate this important task seems very important from a customer and getting important tasks done point of view. On a related note, will there be a firmware update to fix the vertical seams in the mirror modes of Scrolls? I want clean mirrors without a big line in them. Is this a result of using a 1080 timing and the device being calibrated to SD timings or something else?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for the concern Derek -- unfortunately we do not have the resources to hire anyone else with those skillsets right now.  While managing product development personally is important to me, delegating firmware tasks is something I would have no trouble doing if resources allowed. Firmware projects have been backlogged for years due to the extended development time required by both TBC2 and Chromagnon.  While that journey has been much longer than I thought it would be, it\'s not a permanent situation -- it\'s just a lengthy one, and one that is nearing its end. With those projects in the past, it will be much easier to provide timely updates.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\'ll be happy to know we have solved the issue in question regarding mirror mode in Scrolls causing a blank pixel or two at the peak of the waveform while in HD modes.  Unfortunately this is not a user serviceable firmware update, as it applies only to the FPGA waveform generator portion of Scrolls and not it\'s microcontroller. If you would like to have the fix applied to your unit, contact us to arrange an RMA at support@lzxindustries.net.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Nathan asked \\"Awesome to see a new case design from you guys! Any chance we\'ll see a 104hp version? Sync daisychaining between cases like vessel? Maybe a separately sold power supply/busboard?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi Nathan -- it\'s great to hear you\'re excited about Vessel Mk2!   Right now we plan to release a single size boat, which is 6U and 2x84HP total.  The goal is to meet as many user requirements as possible initially, and the priorities there are that it\'s 19\\" rack mountable and deep enough to fit all prior generations of LZX modules.   A 2x104HP variation would be easy to implement if we keep getting requests for it, but we want to successfully launch the 2x84HP version first.  There will indeed be a separately sold power supply/busboard -- two in fact, one for DC power & sync distribution, and another traditional EuroRack power supply inheriting from our low noise Capsule Power design.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Chichi asked \\"What kind of functionality will the ILDA inputs and outputs [on Chromagnon] have??\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nHi Chichi -- the ILDA IO is very interesting to me personally, because it is a feature that fully embraces the design concept of Chromagnon as a processing instrument which spans multiple dimensions. At the heart of Chromagnon is a massive analog vector processor -- the algebraic functions inside take voltages representing 2D coordinates and transform them through user controls and high frequency voltage control. These 2D transformations such as size, position, rotation, and skew can be applied universally to any XY voltages! In Chromagnon\'s case, the front and  of the instrument offers four primary ways to source the initial signals: horizontal & vertical video ramp waveform generators, the UV chroma colorspace of a video input, the XY coordinates of an ILDA input (like the Neon Captain Radiator), or the UV chroma colorspace of an ILDA input.  So put more simply, Chromagnon can be used as an analog post processor for your laser visuals -- if your ILDA generator is creating a star shaped pattern, Chromagnon could be used, for example, to rotate, warp, resize, or animate that pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Michael asked \\"Hey Lars, I just placed a preorder for the Chromagnon and I was wondering two things\u2026First off, if I were to put together a 104hp skiff to complement it, are there any modules that having Chromagnon de-necessitates having? I know you recommended the DWO & DSG to pad it out, but are there any modules that I specifically *wouldn\u2019t* need because they\u2019re redundant? Or does Chromagnon only cover functions not covered by other modules?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two approaches to using Chromagnon along with LZX modular.  \\r\\n\\r\\n1) Using it as a big module inside your modular system.  In this case, your primary inputs and outputs are from decoder and encoder modules like TBC2 & ESG3, and the output of Chromagnon is taken from it\'s XY + RGB outputs instead of it\'s video outputs. In this case, there aren\'t any redundancies. Chromagnon becomes LZX\'s \\"complex vector processor\\" in the modular sense. \\r\\n\\r\\n2) Using it as your core instrument, with other modules as expanders.  In this case, your primary video input and output are Chromagnon itself, and other modules are introduced simply to expand the existing workflow. For example, DWO3 could be added to add more modulation and pattern sources.  So the redundant modules in this use case would be TBC2 and ESG3 (those focusing on external video inputs and outputs.)  All of the other modules can find a place in your \\"Chromagnon expander\\" workflow. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Michael also asked, \\"I\u2019m wondering if you have an ETA for the Vessel cases, and if you might have a recommendation (or recommendations to steer clear) for other eurorack cases out there. I was thinking about a Doepfer A-100 (6U/84HP), but the forums seem to be a little conflicting as to whether that\u2019s ideal.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nAny EuroRack case is a good candidate, but we do recommend that even if you have a powered case, that you install our DC Distro module to supply power to Gen3 LZX modules via their 12V barrel connectors.  Otherwise the video modules will quickly exhaust a typical EuroRack power supply\'s current limit. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Michael also asked, \\"Are you planning any new or different version of the Sensory Translator? Or else can you recommend the most flexible options for audio reactivity? That would be my priority in selecting anything to go with the Chromagnonen.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, I am planning to release a new audio-visualization tools module in the Gen3 lineup, but it is not an active project right now.  I recommend Aural Scan by VH.S as a great envelope follower / audio-visualization accompaniment for Chromagnon. Other envelope followers in the audio EuroRack world can work well for this use too, but Aural Scan is specifically scaled to LZX voltage range, and includes a video rate crossfading/scanning function.  Also, any of Chromagnon\'s parameters can be directly modulated by audio signals without requiring any sort of interface at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil next time,\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"double-visions","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/double-visions","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-26-double-visions/index.md","title":"Double Visions","description":"A quick update for last week.","date":"2024-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Chromagnon","permalink":"/blog/tags/chromagnon","description":"Posts about the Chromagnon video synthesizer"}],"readingTime":1.165,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Larsen","title":"Product Designer","url":"https://github.com/creatorlars","imageURL":"https://github.com/creatorlars.png","key":"lars","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"double-visions","title":"Double Visions","authors":["lars"],"tags":["chromagnon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Marching Forward","permalink":"/blog/marching-forward"},"nextItem":{"title":"Arcs & Anvils","permalink":"/blog/arcs-and-anvils"}},"content":"A quick update for last week.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n- Finished writing firmware drivers for Chromagnon\'s mux controls.

RevF was a major overhaul of our previous hardware approach, which combined what was 3 previous assemblies into a single board.  For that reason, it required several weeks of intense work, and a complete reroute of the board design. \\r\\n\\r\\nRevG on the other hand is a minor revision -- it\'s purpose is to resolve any design issues present in the RevF board, like parts value changes, CAD footprint problems, or drafting bloopers. \\r\\n\\r\\nAny time a board is tested for the first time, it\'s almost a guarantee that something will need to be adjusted. That\'s why on any of your LZX modules, it is quite rare to see a RevA board used on a device in production.  By the time we end up in production, it is usually after several iterations. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo make my point, RevG is not going to take months of work, like RevF did.  The CAD part of the revisions will be done in a couple of days, and the next hardware  review will be focused on the changes that were made between RevF and RevG.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, we need to sign off on final versions of Chromagnon\'s other pieces, such as design for the case/enclosure, button caps, and control knobs.  We learned a lot during design of Gen3\'s control knob mold, and there are several adjustments I want to make, to ensure seamless production.  We have a Formlabs Form 3 printer here, which helps a lot when working on molded parts design -- we can usually print a prototype in a few hours or overnight, allowing us to iterate on a design daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also some firmware polishing to do -- mostly involving porting over portions of TBC2\'s codebase. \\r\\n\\r\\nRecording demo videos is a big priority!

My intention is to fill up a 104hp skiff I already have, if only for the sake of putting any other money towards more modules rather than another skiff. What other modules would you recommend to fill out that space? My primary interests are pattern generation and manipulation, and responsiveness to audio; I\u2019m less concerned with processing external video.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nFilling a 104HP skiff with Chromagnon and other LZX modules is a great plan!  Chromagnon is exciting on its own, but you will get more out of it if you have a variety of external modulation sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would recommend DWO3 (Dual Oscillator), DSG3 (Dual Shape Generator) and Scrolls (Dual Animation/Scrolling Plane Generator.)  Chromagnon is very rotary in it\'s internal animation capabilities -- making two things spin, for example, or making a plane spin within another spinning plane. Scrolls\' linear movement (which is like a camera pan or wrapping background) will complement that nicely.  DWO3 and DSG3 will make more complex pattern generation possible, and provide different image processing capabilities as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Michael also said, \\"I was just looking through the Chromagnon updates and saw you mention that you\u2019re in SE Portland\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you haven\'t connected with them yet, check out the Portland Synth Library and the PDX Video Mixer events!\\r\\n\\r\\nGot more questions?

This week was another steady week of Chromagnon testing and firmware updates for the new core assembly, with a few foibles.  (My trusty lab laptop needs a new power jack installed.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nLast week we ended the Chromagnon Core RevF verification process -- testing that all circuits are passing signal and the embedded system is communicating with all of its peripherals. This week we entered the validation process -- that is, testing that all functions are working as desired.  To do that, I compare the model for the design, represented by a software simulation, against the measured output of each circuit (using my oscilloscope and other testing tools.)   \\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the challenge of designing complex hardware systems like Chromagnon, is that you can not power up a new board until it\'s already designed, fabricated, and assembled.  So the verification & validation processes need to happen in cycles, with the board being revised to fix issues in each iteration. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince designing the LZX Visionary modular series, we have used software simulations and spreadsheets for validating the functional model of a module or device.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a simplified example, our typical attenuverter circuit could be modeled something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Given POTENTIOMETER is a bipolar voltage up to +/-1.00V\\r\\n- Given INPUT is a bipolar voltage up to +/-2.00V\\r\\n- The OUTPUT voltage shall be represented by the following formula:\\r\\n- OUTPUT = INPUT * POTENTIOMETER\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that we have defined a functional model, we can write a test plan:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Set POTENTIOMETER to 1.00V\\r\\n- Set INPUT to 1.00V\\r\\n- Measure OUTPUT voltage\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd pass/fail conditions:\\r\\n\\r\\n- PASS: Output measurement is 1.00V\\r\\n- FAIL: Output measurement is not 1.00V\\r\\n\\r\\nMy job right now involves working through a list of hundreds of cases like this, comparing results to the software simulation I wrote last quarter.  Next week I expect to be moving past all the tests, applying the edits to the circuit board design, and tackling a few missing firmware functions -- like range calibration for the rotation function, and user prompted firmware upgrade via SD card. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Rob asked \\"There\'s a few modules from other toolmakers which play nicely with LZX modules (the one I\'m specifically thinking of is BPMC\'s Fluxus Duo.) Is there anything different about the Chromag\'s build that would change said interactivity, or should those modules also be compatible?\ufeff\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nChromagnon follows the same voltage and IO standards as the modular system. Glitch type devices may always cause issues with certain displays or any video devices, of course.  Usually you want the glitch to be between the output and a display that\'s tolerant of the glitches.  So for example, you could patch Chromagnon\'s composite video output into a Fluxus Duo, and then to a CRT display -- that would be a natural combo!\\r\\n\\r\\nGot more questions?

But I must say, even with (understandable) delays, and much OPM wrapped up in the Chromagnon project, you leave a helluva pretty wake behind online. For months, I\'ve been combing forums for tidbits of DIY video synthesis info, building my own open source bits, and collecting vintage mixers... All the while coming across these \'Lars is a genius,\' posts along with claims that \'Lars is the hardest working man alive.\' Etc etc... And now here I am making a choice not to buy a pre-order second-hand and skip the line, just to feel like I\'ve contributed a new bit of energy to your company. I\'m sure to get my own dopamine squirt as I watch y\'all push through the last bit. Congrats, my guy, and more power to you.\\" **\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are very kind (and thanks for the preorder!)

We all wish you success in your video journeys ahead -- pop in our Discord channel and say hi if you\'ve got anything we can help you with.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Martijn asked \\"How is it going with the proposed new DIY line of modules?\\" I learned so much of the Cadet ( and Castle) series.. they inspired me to start making my own modules because learning from your open schematics kickstarted my way into combining ideas and idea blocks to get to new concepts. I can\'t wait to see your next (open source) designs!\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s great to hear there is continuing interest in open source and DIY designs!  Currently we do not have any active DIY designs in development, but there are some ideas on the backburner.  We are also offering our power and FPGA subassemblies via our webstore.  With some better documentation, I think these could be employed by DIY projects.  I think one of my interests here is to document some low parts count, single-supply designs that focus on really maximizing what you can do with ICs that are quite expensive, but make very low parts count implementations possible.  You are one of a few makers who really took off with the initial proposition of the Cadet series:  take these building blocks, and build on them.  Many compliments from us to your work, which we would love to see more of.  (Check out Martijn\'s projects at https://www.reverselandfill.org.)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Casper says \\"First of all: love the new format. I wonder what it is in relation to cashflow and keep a business running why you don\'t do another run on good selling products. If I look at Memory Palace or with some older Vidiot, gear prices reach astronomical hights because the demand is so much higher than supply. I know there where some revision ideas for MP, but if you\'re clear in what you sell and what the future will bring nobody will curse you. Call it the boutique synths if you ask me.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for the practical suggestion -- you\'re not wrong, and in part this is what we\'ve been trying to do over the past couple years of delays in general.  Part of the issue is that even though we own the designs you\'re mentioning, we still have lots of parts cost and labor in assembling them -- everything is assembled with in house labor -- and any resources we have, we need to split across both Chromagnon and maintaining our existing modular lineup.  Right now we have a good strategy, I think, and it\'s mostly up to the strength of the overall synth market regarding our cashflow.  Sales of our existing modular catalog are the main push forward to getting the job done faster rather than later.  We have some new accessories to that effect that will be available this quarter, and hopefully that will help.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil next time,\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"the-core-has-landed","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-core-has-landed","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-12-the-core-has-landed copy/index.md","title":"The Core Has Landed","description":"Howdy Chromagnon-folk.

Regression testing will verify that everything working on the last revision is still working.  Integration testing will verify that the core PCB operates as expected when combined with the control PCB\'s user interface and firmware.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo test the power supplies I asked our SMT assembly technician Andrew to build a variant of the big board with only the power entry and primary power supply components installed. This means that we have removed all of the liabilities from the test that may interfere with power supply performance for issues unrelated to the power supply circuit itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n ![](./pcb2.png)  \\r\\n\\r\\n*All power rail indicator LEDs are go!*\\r\\n\\r\\nTo perform these tests I used our Fluke 115 multimeter and Rigol MSO5074 Oscilloscope. After discovering one issue with a missed schematic connection, and altering a few resistor values, the power supplies are fully verified. I\'ll come back to this assembly in a few days when I get into performance testing, so that I can see how the power supply\'s noise floor is effected under load.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./pcb3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n*Four quadrant multiplier board under test*\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next tests involved the four quadrant multiplier test board. This is such a key circuit in Chromagnon\'s design, that I knew from experience it would solve problems to have it on an isolated test board. Like the power supply assembly, I may come back to this board later on in the verification process if I need a baseline established between how the circuit performs in isolation vs how it performs with all the other parts on the combined assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext week I\'ll share our continuing progress with verification of the Chromagnon Core PCB. Hans (our SMT machine) is busy on the full assembly as I write this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are a few more questions you asked after the last post.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Jim asked \\"[Is there] a risk that if sales of non Chromagnon modules slows down that customers might not receive their Chromagnon pre-orders?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowing sales may slow Chromagnon\'s production process or the speed at which orders are shipped, but it does not imply there is a risk you won\'t receive your order. Shipping all Chromagnon orders is our foremost priority.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Paul asked \\"The future looks very bright for Chromagnon, will LZX in the future move towards basic 3D shape animation, maybe modules that can replicate PC graphics from 80s-90s?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nI think adding more 3D controls will be probable with the upcoming revision to our flagship digital video synthesizer, Memory Palace. I would love to be able to map video inputs to the sides of a spinning cube, or other Amiga demo scene era figures.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Garrett asked \\"Hey Lars, any chance the roadmap will updated for the post Chromagnon era? Definitely a fan of hearing more about module concepts or design/features to expand the modular series.\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the modular arena, we are prototyping some new options in the IO module categories. We also plan to release a large rotation/affine matrix module in the wake of Chromagnon\'s release. There\'s always a list of hundreds of module ideas around here -- but the times in which we have got ahead of ourselves, we\'ve regretted it. So we\'re staying fairly tight lipped on future project details right now. This year will mostly focus on more user resources, manuals, documentation and video tutorials for the existing modular series -- and of course, our most ambitious module yet: Chromagnon!\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pat asked \\"Do you know when sensory translator will be back in stock? Or do you have plans to make a new model of it?\\"**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe don\'t have an audio envelope on deck at the moment, but definitely check out Aural Scan by VH.S. It is a new triple channel audio envelope released in 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil next time,\\r\\n\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"we-answer-your-questions","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/we-answer-your-questions","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-05-we-answer-your-questions/index.md","title":"We Answer Your Questions","description":"Greetings Chromagnonites.","date":"2024-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Chromagnon","permalink":"/blog/tags/chromagnon","description":"Posts about the Chromagnon video synthesizer"}],"readingTime":4.5,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Larsen","title":"Product Designer","url":"https://github.com/creatorlars","imageURL":"https://github.com/creatorlars.png","key":"lars","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"we-answer-your-questions","title":"We Answer Your Questions","authors":["lars"],"tags":["chromagnon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Core Has Landed","permalink":"/blog/the-core-has-landed"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Year In Review","permalink":"/blog/the-year-in-review"}},"content":"Greetings Chromagnonites. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\u2019ve had a great start to the year here in the workshop.  A handy form was provided in the last journal entry and you sent in a lot of questions! This post will be focused on answering all of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pat asked \u201cDo you have any plans to update the Chromagnon spreadsheet any time soon?\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nPat, the most up to date information is here in this weekly journal. I\u2019ve added a note to the shared spreadsheet to reflect that. \\r\\n\\r\\nRight now we are laser focused on getting the project production ready.\\r\\nOnce we hit production ready, our focus shifts to shipping unit one.\\r\\nFrom that point, our focus shifts to shipping all pre-orders.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt each stage, the variability of the project timeline decreases, and our ability to accurately forecast your delivery date increases.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time we hit production ready we\u2019ll have a straight shot to shipping unit one. It will be a list of tasks with predictable timelines, and low chance of delays.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time we hit shipping unit one, it will finally be possible to provide a  more accurate shipping estimate and schedule. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\u2019d like to be production ready in February, and shipping unit one in March-April.  After that, fulfilling all orders could happen in a few weeks or will drag out several months. The pace we can fulfill will be set by the overall strength of our sales and cash flow.  I\u2019ll be updating you here, weekly.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Graham asked \u201cAs the release date approaches, when do you expect to unpause the pre-orders?\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nGraham, we are currently accepting pre-orders for Chromagnon. We just do not plan to advertise pre-orders until we reach the shipping unit one milestone.  You may place a pre-order via our website.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Graham also asked \u201cI\'ve noticed some people are selling their pre-orders. Is that a legit or sketchy process?\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\u2019s fine, Graham \u2013 just make sure you loop our sales team in on it before any money is exchanged.  We\u2019ll be happy to validate whether or not a pre-order is valid, and transfer ownership to you at the seller\u2019s request. Just e-mail sales@lzxindustries.net.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Brandon said \u201cThinking about Chromagnon being at the forefront [of an image processing] focused rig currently, what are your recommendations for modules that are functional today and enhanced by a Chromagnon later?\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nBrandon, my first choice for Chromagnon expansion is more modulators. Chromagnon has some powerful internal modulators, but to maximize its potential, you\u2019ll want a variety of modulation sources to feed it.  I asked around the workshop and here\'s everyone\'s take.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Two DWO3s\\" -Andrew\\r\\n\\"Bunch of DWO3s\\" - Nick\\r\\n\\"Scrolls or DWO3 or DSG3 or Ribbons\\" - Me\\r\\n\\r\\n**Bradley said \u201cNo questions really... just wanted to say how much I love the idea of the journal. Just giving us a peek inside your workshop really feels like it breaks down the walls of brand and customer.\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nCheers Bradley.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Zoe asked \u201cWhat\'s the plan for Chromagnon after pre-orders are fulfilled? I\'d love to budget for my own!\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nZoe! We plan to have a strong launch and keep Chromagnon available for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Flo asked \u201cWhat about the firmware for Diver? Is this project abandoned?\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nHowdy Flo \u2013 yes, Diver was discontinued a few years ago now.  The firmware has been published to our GitHub for open source development.  Diver had a few issues \u2013 only one can be considered critical to operation: a glitch or blip in the output every few seconds. This issue is related to the hardware, and not the firmware -- it can be resolved by changing your sync configuration and routing.  Reach out to support@lzxindustries.net and we\u2019ll be happy to work through it with you.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Marco asked \u201cHow about Chromagnon and ILDA? Could I use it for controlling lasers in a safe way, you know frequency limitations, etc...?\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nYes Marco! Chromagnon has integrated low pass filters for the ILDA outputs, with 4 different frequency cutoffs (these are adjustable with the rear DIP switch settings.)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Mike asked \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s video synthesis on other planets? Have any other life forms placed any orders for Chromagnons? Also, what are the chances that ancient civilizations developed comparable technology?\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nMike, if species on other planets also developed visual sensors like the eyeballs and cones of animals on Planet Earth, and tamed electrical currents like humans have, I am certain that technologies similar to Chromagnon would emerge, sooner or later. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it would be difficult to determine the nature of entities placing Chromagnon pre-orders, I assume they are fellow humans.  It\u2019s probable that dolphins and cats would be placing orders, if they did not lack opposable thumbs. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think the visual technologies of ancient civilizations, such as the Atlanteans, more likely had to do with primitive mankind\u2019s deeper understanding of remote viewing and alternate states of consciousness than it does with an electrical device like a video synthesizer.  But I would love to be disproven.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Clark asked \u201cHow will I know when it\u2019s shipping\u2026 and what number on the list I am?\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nClark, we will send you an individual e-mail before your order ships, to make sure your shipping address is correct.  We\u2019ll publish an order number queue after we reach our ship unit one milestone.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext week, I\u2019ll be back to sharing details about the Chromagnon Core PCB that is incoming, and our plan for tackling the hardware review.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nLars"},{"id":"the-year-in-review","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-year-in-review","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-30-the-molten-core/index.md","title":"The Year In Review","description":"It\'s Friday... howdy!

I\'ve put about 150 hours into this board since the beginning of December, including PCB layout, schematic drafting, parts research and a few SPICE simulations.  Even though it inherits from earlier revisions of the circuit, this board combines what was previously 3x separate PCB assemblies -- so it\'s more like a redesign than a revision of the layout.  It is without a doubt the largest and most complex board we\'ve done at LZX to date. \\r\\n\\r\\n![](./core.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what\'s next?!  This board will take 7-9 days to manufacture (starting after the holiday) at our PCB fabrication vendor, and then 3-4 days to ship.  That means it will land in the third week of 2024.  In the meantime I will be writing test and verification plans for reviewing the assembly, and making adjustments to the firmware.  The production crew will begin importing the list of parts into our manufacturing resource planning system and preparing programming files for our surface mount assembly machine -- and also placing orders for any parts we may need. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat all may sound like a lot, but it\'s the kind of work we\'re used to around here.    If everything goes smoothly, we\'ll be turning it on for the first time around January 20th. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to work on this assembly, I\'ve also been tuning some new systems and processes to go into effect in the new year -- task planning boards & schedules, design templates, social media calendars -- all of which I hope will enable us to juggle a wider variety of tasks across the company, and keep our sales strong -- something that will be necessary to deliver Chromagnon as soon as possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ll break some of those plans down for you in the next posts, and also want to take the time to describe the concept and inception of the Chromagnon instrument, and what I hope it accomplishes for video artists.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, none of you have written in questions or comments.

At LZX we are wrapping up an exhausting year, and probably our most challenging yet.  It has been difficult to speak publicly on our ongoing plans and projects with a mammoth in the room: Chromagnon is multiple years overdue, and I have failed to accurately estimate the shipping date a few times now.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking this instrument possible has been a fight.  When circumstances have shifted and delays are suffered, I tend to freeze \u2013 preferring to bury myself in the work of pushing past the setbacks and hoping that I have better news to share later. As the months drag on, this leads to a lack of communication from us to you, and you are left with question marks, sparse information, and robbed of the choice to cheer us onward as we get closer.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSo I\u2019ve committed to regularly reporting the weather until we get this Chromagnon job done, and beyond.  I will be doing that through posting updates on this blog, whether there is notable progress or not.  In each post, I will try to answer any questions that you write in to sales@lzxindustries.net.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe intention is to make this an ongoing conversation and a camera angle behind the scenes -- rather than a sporadic update.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./crt.png) \\r\\n\\r\\n*Chromagnon prototype testing on the Commodore 1702*\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the next post, I\u2019ll list our LZX stats sheet for 2023 \u2013 boards designed, goals met, projects shipped, dreams born, nightmares silenced.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBut let\u2019s end this one with an FAQ, and get that out of the way.\\r\\n\\r\\n**When is Chromagnon shipping?**  Knowing when exactly Chromagnon will ship is difficult to estimate. Our biggest obstacle at this stage is cashflow. The synthesizer market is volatile, and we may have to continue pivoting back and forth with other projects to keep the company going.  If there\'s a last minute issue with the production articles or molded parts, that could also delay us by several weeks.  We are a few months behind the latest estimates represented by the production calendar, and our plan to be shipping by the end of 2023.  The milestone we are about to hit is where I wanted to be in September.  If plans go well, the first quarter of 2024 will encompass all of the activities remaining before we ship.  That includes validation of the production assembly, development of a production test platform, and production of the molded parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What happened with Chromagnon in 2023?** Low sales have hit the whole synth industry this year, and it required us to finish and ship several smaller projects (like our new module Scrolls) to make ends meet over the Summer and Fall.  It is a two steps forward, one step back situation \u2013 much like the past 3 years have been.  If we could throw all our time and resources at Chromagnon, we would -- but our survival mandates a balanced allocation. This is not a situation I like being in, but we are trying to make the best of whatever plan gets us closer to Chromagnon\'s shipping day.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Where is the Chromagnon demo video?** I would prefer to not show the hardware output until the production first article passes our testing.  The current prototype represents a huge step toward completing the project, but it seems best to wait until it\'s all 100% before investing time in filming a functional walkthrough.  After this week, production article testing is our next milestone to hit.  From that milestone, my R&D workload lessens significantly, and filming an exhaustive video walkthrough becomes the priority.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**How is it going, Lars?!** Outside of the beleaguered pre-order scenario, I am very happy with how Chromagnon has taken shape, and the past several weeks of work represent moving past the point of any remaining design issues and implementation decisions. It is still an instrumentation concept I am quite passionate about, and it has been very rewarding bringing it to life. I am grateful for the support and companionship of my teammates: Jonah, Chad, Ed, Nick and Andrew, who have stuck with LZX through some rough moments this year, and for my wife, kids and cats, who permit me to work long hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nTomorrow, we are back to wrapping up the layout for this massive assembly, checking it twice, and getting some PCBs ordered before the holiday.\\r\\n\\r\\nChromagnon Core PCBA RevF (WORK IN PROGRESS)\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nLars\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. E-mail your questions to sales@lzxindustries.net and I\u2019ll answer them in the next post."}]}}')}}]);
