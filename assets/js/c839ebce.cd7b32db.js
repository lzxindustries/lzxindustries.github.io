Approaching these instruments, I had many firmware and software projects behind me \u2013 but none at this level of structural complexity.

Hardware scales easily \u2013 five circuits is five circuits \u2013 but in software, writing a state control system for five asynchronous modules is a different beast entirely.  The experience has definitely kindled a love for embedded development with modern C++ in general, and I look forward to doing more of it.

With hardware development and workshop projects, tasks are shorter -- 1 to 16 hrs each -- to do a board layout, or revision, or build a prototype.  With software or circuit design it's often 3-6 week sprints, during which it can be difficult for me to do anything but write code or run simulations.
