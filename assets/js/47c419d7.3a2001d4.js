Our biggest obstacle at this stage is cashflow. The synthesizer market is volatile, and we may have to continue pivoting back and forth with other projects to keep the company going.  If there's a last minute issue with the production articles or molded parts, that could also delay us by several weeks.  We are a few months behind the latest estimates represented by the production calendar, and our plan to be shipping by the end of 2023.  The milestone we are about to hit is where I wanted to be in September.  If plans go well, the first quarter of 2024 will encompass all of the activities remaining before we ship.
