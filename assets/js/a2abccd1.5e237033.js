I've put about 150 hours into this board since the beginning of December, including PCB layout, schematic drafting, parts research and a few SPICE simulations.  Even though it inherits from earlier revisions of the circuit, this board combines what was previously 3x separate PCB assemblies -- so it's more like a redesign than a revision of the layout.  It is without a doubt the largest and most complex board we've done at LZX to date."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.img,{src:n(6117).A+"",width:"3456",height:"1728"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So what's next?!  This board will take 7-9 days to manufacture (starting after the holiday) at our PCB fabrication vendor, and then 3-4 days to ship.  That means it will land in the third week of 2024.  In the meantime I will be writing test and verification plans for reviewing the assembly, and making adjustments to the firmware.
