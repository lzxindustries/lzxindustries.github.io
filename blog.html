<p><em>Crossed wires</em></p>
<p>There are only a couple more validation steps left. For next week I hope that testing is complete and that the core board is revised and ready for production. From that point, we can move into preparing the injection mold order for the enclosure and designing a rear finishing panel, which will include legending for Chromagnon&#x27;s rear connectors and switches.</p>
<p>This week we also finished preparing CAD files for another one of this quarter&#x27;s projects, which is a prototype EuroRack case design and power busboard.  Here&#x27;s a render of the work in progress.</p>

<p>Now onto your questions…</p>
<p><strong>Mario asked, &quot;The big question is are there going to be preorders soon? Are you going to send some to Schneidersladen or Raw Voltage?</strong></p>
<p>You can place a preorder at any time, either with us or the retailer of your choice.  Both of the retailers you mention have Chromagnon on preorder, but we can&#x27;t speak to the availability of what they&#x27;ve reserved with us; please reach out to them directly.  We will be shipping in the sequence that we received Chromagnon preorders, regardless of whether the customer was a retailer or an individual.</p>
<p><strong>Michael asked, &quot;I am just getting into video synthesis and I’m thinking about getting a Chromagnon once it’s released because it seems like a solid one-stop centerpiece for any rig. My intention is to fill up a 104hp skiff I already have, if only for the sake of putting any other money towards more modules rather than another skiff. What other modules would you recommend to fill out that space? My primary interests are pattern generation and manipulation, and responsiveness to audio; I’m less concerned with processing external video.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Filling a 104HP skiff with Chromagnon and other LZX modules is a great plan!  Chromagnon is exciting on its own, but you will get more out of it if you have a variety of external modulation sources.</p>
<p>I would recommend DWO3 (Dual Oscillator), DSG3 (Dual Shape Generator) and Scrolls (Dual Animation/Scrolling Plane Generator.)  Chromagnon is very rotary in it&#x27;s internal animation capabilities -- making two things spin, for example, or making a plane spin within another spinning plane. Scrolls&#x27; linear movement (which is like a camera pan or wrapping background) will complement that nicely.  DWO3 and DSG3 will make more complex pattern generation possible, and provide different image processing capabilities as well.</p>
<p><strong>Michael also said, &quot;I was just looking through the Chromagnon updates and saw you mention that you’re in SE Portland&quot;</strong></p>
<p>If you haven&#x27;t connected with them yet, check out the Portland Synth Library and the PDX Video Mixer events!</p>

<p>It&#x27;s nice and sunny here in SE Portland. This week was another steady week of Chromagnon testing and firmware updates for the new core assembly, with a few foibles.  (My trusty lab laptop needs a new power jack installed.)</p>
<p>Last week we ended the Chromagnon Core RevF verification process -- testing that all circuits are passing signal and the embedded system is communicating with all of its peripherals. This week we entered the validation process -- that is, testing that all functions are working as desired.  To do that, I compare the model for the design, represented by a software simulation, against the measured output of each circuit (using my oscilloscope and other testing tools.)</p>
<p>Part of the challenge of designing complex hardware systems like Chromagnon, is that you can not power up a new board until it&#x27;s already designed, fabricated, and assembled.  So the verification &amp; validation processes need to happen in cycles, with the board being revised to fix issues in each iteration.</p>
<p>Since designing the LZX Visionary modular series, we have used software simulations and spreadsheets for validating the functional model of a module or device.</p>
<p>As a simplified example, our typical attenuverter circuit could be modeled something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given POTENTIOMETER is a bipolar voltage up to +/-1.00V</li>
<li>Given INPUT is a bipolar voltage up to +/-2.00V</li>
<li>The OUTPUT voltage shall be represented by the following formula:</li>
<li>OUTPUT = INPUT * POTENTIOMETER</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have defined a functional model, we can write a test plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set POTENTIOMETER to 1.00V</li>
<li>Set INPUT to 1.00V</li>
<li>Measure OUTPUT voltage</li>
</ul>
<p>And pass/fail conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>PASS: Output measurement is 1.00V</li>
<li>FAIL: Output measurement is not 1.00V</li>
</ul>
<p>My job right now involves working through a list of hundreds of cases like this, comparing results to the software simulation I wrote last quarter.  Next week I expect to be moving past all the tests, applying the edits to the circuit board design, and tackling a few missing firmware functions -- like range calibration for the rotation function, and user prompted firmware upgrade via SD card.</p>
<p><strong>Rob asked &quot;There&#x27;s a few modules from other toolmakers which play nicely with LZX modules (the one I&#x27;m specifically thinking of is BPMC&#x27;s Fluxus Duo.) Is there anything different about the Chromag&#x27;s build that would change said interactivity, or should those modules also be compatible?﻿&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Chromagnon follows the same voltage and IO standards as the modular system. Glitch type devices may always cause issues with certain displays or any video devices, of course.  Usually you want the glitch to be between the output and a display that&#x27;s tolerant of the glitches.  So for example, you could patch Chromagnon&#x27;s composite video output into a Fluxus Duo, and then to a CRT display -- that would be a natural combo!</p>

<p>We had a busy week here, catching up on activities after being iced in last week. I spent most of the week reviewing the Chromagnon Core PCB RevF, and am relieved to report the assembly has passed everything in the 42-step test plan I mentioned in the last blog post.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/assembly-390915eb71fcefddb9b62ed031fa9b56.png" width="1024" height="752" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The full assembly is looking much slimmer now, with this new board -- something that will allow Chromagnon to easily fit in more EuroRack cases. Power consumption is sitting just under 1.5 Amps on +12V input, so we recommend using it with the included 12V DC adapter.</p>
<p>Next week I hope to show off some more videos of Chromagnon&#x27;s output and transition to working on other pre-production deliverables -- such as working with our contractor to make a mold for Chromagnon&#x27;s enclosure and control knobs.</p>
<p><strong>Carl asked for clarification about Memory Palace Mk1 and the upcoming Memory Palace Mk2 feature sets in regards to SD and HD video formats.</strong></p>
<p>Memory Palace Mk1 will support SD modes only.</p>
<p>Memory Palace Mk2 will support SD and HD modes.</p>
<p><strong>Tristan said in reference to Chromagnon: &quot;I&#x27;m new to video synthesis so I want to know what it will be capable of... but there are (to the best of my knowledge) no demo videos out there.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>We will be recording demo content of Chromagnon very soon.</p>
<p><strong>RobG asked about screen saver features for Memory Palace &amp; TBC2, 240p60 support for TBC2, and black frontpanels for Expedition series modules.</strong></p>
<p>You&#x27;ll be happy to know that a firmware update was released for TBC2 with the screen saver a few months ago. You can get it on the TBC2 page of our website. Additionally, you can find black Expedition Series front panels for sale on the site. 240p60 support is coming in the next version of TBC2&#x27;s firmware, we have it working nicely with an SNES console. We will add screen saver support for Memory Palace Mk1 on it&#x27;s next update as well. Both of those updates will come this year, following Chromagnon&#x27;s launch.</p>
<p><strong>Leslie said &quot;Not a question but a statement: Keep the content coming from Andrew Dobbels. The &#x27;Dobbels Demos Ribbons&#x27; video on YouTube is some of the best teaching of concepts and patching I&#x27;ve ever seen coming out from LZX. Its thorough, specific, and paced to allow for easy patch along at home.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Leslie! There are more Dobbels videos in the works, and be sure to catch his live stream on the LZX Twitch channel every Wednesday at 7PM PST. For those of you who missed it, check it out here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maxfR128_Ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maxfR128_Ec</a></p>

Here in Portland we have all been iced into our homes since the holiday on Monday, so the typical workshop crew is working abroad.  We&#x27;ve focused that on getting ahead on content creation for new videos and social media posts -- a project that is going well and should buy us some free days in February.  I&#x27;m thankful everyone in the shop also has systems at home, or else this would not have been possible.</p>
<p>On the Chromagnon front, we reached a firmware milestone this week, with the updates to account for pin mapping changes in the latest board revision. That clears the way for the rest of the hardware review.  The hardware review task list is 42 items long, 12 of which are now done.  I&#x27;m hoping to be done with the rest of them sometime next week -- so next week&#x27;s post can be focused more on those details.</p>
<p>Here is some more Q&amp;A!  Don&#x27;t forget to write in your questions using the form at <a href="https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ian asks &quot;With things moving steadily towards the HD future, should we expect to see a firmware upgrade for Memory Palace?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Yes!  Expect a Memory Palace update after Chromagnon starts shipping. We will be combining development efforts there with development of Memory Palace Mk2. Memory Palace doesn&#x27;t support HD modes, but will support some of the other revisions and bug fixes in the Mk2 firmware.</p>
<p>**Joshua wrote in and said &quot;No questions, as I&#x27;m reasonably new to this LZX thing you&#x27;ve got going on, and I&#x27;m sure the answers exist somewhere... But I must say, even with (understandable) delays, and much OPM wrapped up in the Chromagnon project, you leave a helluva pretty wake behind online. For months, I&#x27;ve been combing forums for tidbits of DIY video synthesis info, building my own open source bits, and collecting vintage mixers... All the while coming across these &#x27;Lars is a genius,&#x27; posts along with claims that &#x27;Lars is the hardest working man alive.&#x27; Etc etc... And now here I am making a choice not to buy a pre-order second-hand and skip the line, just to feel like I&#x27;ve contributed a new bit of energy to your company. I&#x27;m sure to get my own dopamine squirt as I watch y&#x27;all push through the last bit. Congrats, my guy, and more power to you.&quot; **</p>
<p>You are very kind (and thanks for the preorder!)  It&#x27;s impossible to accept these nice comments without pointing out that I often get the credit for work which is the result of a team of very dedicated and talented individuals. We all wish you success in your video journeys ahead -- pop in our Discord channel and say hi if you&#x27;ve got anything we can help you with.</p>
<p><strong>Martijn asked &quot;How is it going with the proposed new DIY line of modules?&quot; I learned so much of the Cadet ( and Castle) series.. they inspired me to start making my own modules because learning from your open schematics kickstarted my way into combining ideas and idea blocks to get to new concepts. I can&#x27;t wait to see your next (open source) designs!&quot;</strong></p>
<p>It&#x27;s great to hear there is continuing interest in open source and DIY designs!  Currently we do not have any active DIY designs in development, but there are some ideas on the backburner.  We are also offering our power and FPGA subassemblies via our webstore.  With some better documentation, I think these could be employed by DIY projects.  I think one of my interests here is to document some low parts count, single-supply designs that focus on really maximizing what you can do with ICs that are quite expensive, but make very low parts count implementations possible.  You are one of a few makers who really took off with the initial proposition of the Cadet series:  take these building blocks, and build on them.  Many compliments from us to your work, which we would love to see more of.  (Check out Martijn&#x27;s projects at <a href="https://www.reverselandfill.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.reverselandfill.org</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Casper says &quot;First of all: love the new format. I wonder what it is in relation to cashflow and keep a business running why you don&#x27;t do another run on good selling products. If I look at Memory Palace or with some older Vidiot, gear prices reach astronomical hights because the demand is so much higher than supply. I know there where some revision ideas for MP, but if you&#x27;re clear in what you sell and what the future will bring nobody will curse you. Call it the boutique synths if you ask me.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for the practical suggestion -- you&#x27;re not wrong, and in part this is what we&#x27;ve been trying to do over the past couple years of delays in general.  Part of the issue is that even though we own the designs you&#x27;re mentioning, we still have lots of parts cost and labor in assembling them -- everything is assembled with in house labor -- and any resources we have, we need to split across both Chromagnon and maintaining our existing modular lineup.  Right now we have a good strategy, I think, and it&#x27;s mostly up to the strength of the overall synth market regarding our cashflow.  Sales of our existing modular catalog are the main push forward to getting the job done faster rather than later.  We have some new accessories to that effect that will be available this quarter, and hopefully that will help.</p>
<p>Until next time,
Lars</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Posts about the Chromagnon video synthesizer" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/chromagnon">Chromagnon</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/the-core-has-landed">The Core Has Landed</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-01-12T00:00:00.000Z">January 12, 2024</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/creatorlars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://github.com/creatorlars.png" alt="Lars Larsen"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/creatorlars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Lars Larsen</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Product Designer">Product Designer</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Howdy Chromagnon-folk. It&#x27;s Friday and the week has been productive at LZX HQ. We&#x27;re expecting snow over this upcoming holiday weekend here in southeast Portland.</p>
<p>The best news of the week was the early arrival of our Chromagnon Core PCB&#x27;s latest revision, as well as a test board for its four quadrant multiplier sub-circuit. After scrambling to get a few parts here faster than we expected we&#x27;d need them, we began assembly and testing on Wednesday. I was planning to talk about the Chromagnon conceptually this week, but since we reached this early milestone we&#x27;ll save that topic for the future -- instead let&#x27;s dig into the hardware itself.</p>
<p>Now begins the long list of tests and measurements involved in verification, the process of making sure every aspect of the new circuit board revision is performing according to Chromagnon&#x27;s design requirements. Verification of this massive 1300+ placement assembly will take 10-15 work days, and we can hope to be done in early February.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pcb-08a4e0aa538f5a3a228572aceca43edc.png" width="480" height="270" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Chromagnon Core RevF power supply testing assembly</em></p>
<p>The verification process is divided into a few phases: unit testing, regression testing, and integration testing. Unit testing will verify the performance of new features -- in this case the entire digital subsystem and power supplies were moved onto the PCB on this revision, and all of them need to be checked. Regression testing will verify that everything working on the last revision is still working.  Integration testing will verify that the core PCB operates as expected when combined with the control PCB&#x27;s user interface and firmware.</p>
<p>To test the power supplies I asked our SMT assembly technician Andrew to build a variant of the big board with only the power entry and primary power supply components installed. This means that we have removed all of the liabilities from the test that may interfere with power supply performance for issues unrelated to the power supply circuit itself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pcb2-c6b58b5931c6960df1ebd849c6e305e3.png" width="480" height="360" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>All power rail indicator LEDs are go!</em></p>
<p>To perform these tests I used our Fluke 115 multimeter and Rigol MSO5074 Oscilloscope. After discovering one issue with a missed schematic connection, and altering a few resistor values, the power supplies are fully verified. I&#x27;ll come back to this assembly in a few days when I get into performance testing, so that I can see how the power supply&#x27;s noise floor is effected under load.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/pcb3-10b624e2d4fcb70039c7a5d4d75b24c8.png" width="480" height="261" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Four quadrant multiplier board under test</em></p>
<p>The next tests involved the four quadrant multiplier test board. This is such a key circuit in Chromagnon&#x27;s design, that I knew from experience it would solve problems to have it on an isolated test board. Like the power supply assembly, I may come back to this board later on in the verification process if I need a baseline established between how the circuit performs in isolation vs how it performs with all the other parts on the combined assembly.</p>
<p>Next week I&#x27;ll share our continuing progress with verification of the Chromagnon Core PCB. Hans (our SMT machine) is busy on the full assembly as I write this.</p>
<p>Here are a few more questions you asked after the last post.</p>
<p><strong>Jim asked &quot;[Is there] a risk that if sales of non Chromagnon modules slows down that customers might not receive their Chromagnon pre-orders?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Slowing sales may slow Chromagnon&#x27;s production process or the speed at which orders are shipped, but it does not imply there is a risk you won&#x27;t receive your order. Shipping all Chromagnon orders is our foremost priority.</p>
<p><strong>Paul asked &quot;The future looks very bright for Chromagnon, will LZX in the future move towards basic 3D shape animation, maybe modules that can replicate PC graphics from 80s-90s?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>I think adding more 3D controls will be probable with the upcoming revision to our flagship digital video synthesizer, Memory Palace. I would love to be able to map video inputs to the sides of a spinning cube, or other Amiga demo scene era figures.</p>
<p><strong>Garrett asked &quot;Hey Lars, any chance the roadmap will updated for the post Chromagnon era? Definitely a fan of hearing more about module concepts or design/features to expand the modular series.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>In the modular arena, we are prototyping some new options in the IO module categories. We also plan to release a large rotation/affine matrix module in the wake of Chromagnon&#x27;s release. There&#x27;s always a list of hundreds of module ideas around here -- but the times in which we have got ahead of ourselves, we&#x27;ve regretted it. So we&#x27;re staying fairly tight lipped on future project details right now. This year will mostly focus on more user resources, manuals, documentation and video tutorials for the existing modular series -- and of course, our most ambitious module yet: Chromagnon!</p>
<p><strong>Pat asked &quot;Do you know when sensory translator will be back in stock? Or do you have plans to make a new model of it?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>We don&#x27;t have an audio envelope on deck at the moment, but definitely check out Aural Scan by VH.S. It is a new triple channel audio envelope released in 2023.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>We’ve had a great start to the year here in the workshop.  A handy form was provided in the last journal entry and you sent in a lot of questions! This post will be focused on answering all of them.</p>
<p><strong>Pat asked “Do you have any plans to update the Chromagnon spreadsheet any time soon?”</strong></p>
<p>Pat, the most up to date information is here in this weekly journal. I’ve added a note to the shared spreadsheet to reflect that.</p>
<p>Right now we are laser focused on getting the project production ready.
Once we hit production ready, our focus shifts to shipping unit one.
From that point, our focus shifts to shipping all pre-orders.</p>
<p>At each stage, the variability of the project timeline decreases, and our ability to accurately forecast your delivery date increases.</p>
<p>By the time we hit production ready we’ll have a straight shot to shipping unit one. It will be a list of tasks with predictable timelines, and low chance of delays.</p>
<p>By the time we hit shipping unit one, it will finally be possible to provide a  more accurate shipping estimate and schedule.</p>
<p>I’d like to be production ready in February, and shipping unit one in March-April.  After that, fulfilling all orders could happen in a few weeks or will drag out several months. The pace we can fulfill will be set by the overall strength of our sales and cash flow.  I’ll be updating you here, weekly.</p>
<p><strong>Graham asked “As the release date approaches, when do you expect to unpause the pre-orders?”</strong></p>
<p>Graham, we are currently accepting pre-orders for Chromagnon. We just do not plan to advertise pre-orders until we reach the shipping unit one milestone.  You may place a pre-order via our website.</p>
<p><strong>Graham also asked “I&#x27;ve noticed some people are selling their pre-orders. Is that a legit or sketchy process?”</strong></p>
<p>That’s fine, Graham – just make sure you loop our sales team in on it before any money is exchanged.  We’ll be happy to validate whether or not a pre-order is valid, and transfer ownership to you at the seller’s request. Just e-mail <a href="mailto:sales@lzxindustries.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sales@lzxindustries.net</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon said “Thinking about Chromagnon being at the forefront [of an image processing] focused rig currently, what are your recommendations for modules that are functional today and enhanced by a Chromagnon later?”</strong></p>
<p>Brandon, my first choice for Chromagnon expansion is more modulators. Chromagnon has some powerful internal modulators, but to maximize its potential, you’ll want a variety of modulation sources to feed it.  I asked around the workshop and here&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s take.</p>
<p>&quot;Two DWO3s&quot; -Andrew
&quot;Bunch of DWO3s&quot; - Nick
&quot;Scrolls or DWO3 or DSG3 or Ribbons&quot; - Me</p>
<p><strong>Bradley said “No questions really... just wanted to say how much I love the idea of the journal. Just giving us a peek inside your workshop really feels like it breaks down the walls of brand and customer.”</strong></p>
<p>Cheers Bradley.</p>
<p><strong>Zoe asked “What&#x27;s the plan for Chromagnon after pre-orders are fulfilled? I&#x27;d love to budget for my own!”</strong></p>
<p>Zoe! We plan to have a strong launch and keep Chromagnon available for many years.</p>
<p><strong>Flo asked “What about the firmware for Diver? Is this project abandoned?”</strong></p>
<p>Howdy Flo – yes, Diver was discontinued a few years ago now.  The firmware has been published to our GitHub for open source development.  Diver had a few issues – only one can be considered critical to operation: a glitch or blip in the output every few seconds. This issue is related to the hardware, and not the firmware -- it can be resolved by changing your sync configuration and routing.  Reach out to <a href="mailto:support@lzxindustries.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@lzxindustries.net</a> and we’ll be happy to work through it with you.</p>
<p><strong>Marco asked “How about Chromagnon and ILDA? Could I use it for controlling lasers in a safe way, you know frequency limitations, etc...?”</strong></p>
<p>Yes Marco! Chromagnon has integrated low pass filters for the ILDA outputs, with 4 different frequency cutoffs (these are adjustable with the rear DIP switch settings.)</p>
<p><strong>Mike asked “Do you think it’s possible that there’s video synthesis on other planets? Have any other life forms placed any orders for Chromagnons? Also, what are the chances that ancient civilizations developed comparable technology?”</strong></p>
<p>Mike, if species on other planets also developed visual sensors like the eyeballs and cones of animals on Planet Earth, and tamed electrical currents like humans have, I am certain that technologies similar to Chromagnon would emerge, sooner or later.</p>
<p>While it would be difficult to determine the nature of entities placing Chromagnon pre-orders, I assume they are fellow humans.  It’s probable that dolphins and cats would be placing orders, if they did not lack opposable thumbs.</p>
<p>I think the visual technologies of ancient civilizations, such as the Atlanteans, more likely had to do with primitive mankind’s deeper understanding of remote viewing and alternate states of consciousness than it does with an electrical device like a video synthesizer.  But I would love to be disproven.</p>
<p><strong>Clark asked “How will I know when it’s shipping… and what number on the list I am?”</strong></p>
<p>Clark, we will send you an individual e-mail before your order ships, to make sure your shipping address is correct.  We’ll publish an order number queue after we reach our ship unit one milestone.</p>
<p>Next week, I’ll be back to sharing details about the Chromagnon Core PCB that is incoming, and our plan for tackling the hardware review.</p>
<p>Yours,
Lars</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Posts about the Chromagnon video synthesizer" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/chromagnon">Chromagnon</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/the-year-in-review">The Year In Review</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-12-30T00:00:00.000Z">December 30, 2023</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/creatorlars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://github.com/creatorlars.png" alt="Lars Larsen"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/creatorlars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Lars Larsen</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Product Designer">Product Designer</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>It&#x27;s Friday... howdy!

<p>My favorite thing about this year was seeing everyone at the company patching regularly, both at work and in their personal artistic lives.  There were lots of lunch break patches on the workshop system and the art gallery on the LZX Discord channel was a constant source of excitement.</p>

With some LZX teammates out of town and under the weather, I&#x27;ve done my best to mind the shop and ship your orders.</p>
<p>Earlier today, I hit the milestone I mentioned a couple of posts back -- releasing CAD files for the sixth revision of the Chromagnon core assembly, and I&#x27;m very pleased by how it&#x27;s taken shape.  I&#x27;ve put about 150 hours into this board since the beginning of December, including PCB layout, schematic drafting, parts research and a few SPICE simulations.  Even though it inherits from earlier revisions of the circuit, this board combines what was previously 3x separate PCB assemblies -- so it&#x27;s more like a redesign than a revision of the layout.  It is without a doubt the largest and most complex board we&#x27;ve done at LZX to date.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/core-49c22d996fe82c7958304fb6962d3988.png" width="3456" height="1728" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So what&#x27;s next?!  This board will take 7-9 days to manufacture (starting after the holiday) at our PCB fabrication vendor, and then 3-4 days to ship.  That means it will land in the third week of 2024.  In the meantime I will be writing test and verification plans for reviewing the assembly, and making adjustments to the firmware.  The production crew will begin importing the list of parts into our manufacturing resource planning system and preparing programming files for our surface mount assembly machine -- and also placing orders for any parts we may need.</p>
<p>That all may sound like a lot, but it&#x27;s the kind of work we&#x27;re used to around here.    If everything goes smoothly, we&#x27;ll be turning it on for the first time around January 20th.</p>
<p>In addition to work on this assembly, I&#x27;ve also been tuning some new systems and processes to go into effect in the new year -- task planning boards &amp; schedules, design templates, social media calendars -- all of which I hope will enable us to juggle a wider variety of tasks across the company, and keep our sales strong -- something that will be necessary to deliver Chromagnon as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll break some of those plans down for you in the next posts, and also want to take the time to describe the concept and inception of the Chromagnon instrument, and what I hope it accomplishes for video artists.</p>
<p>So far, none of you have written in questions or comments.  I&#x27;ve created a form to make that easier, located here: <a href="https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wkf.ms/47lhPPA</a>.  Let me know what&#x27;s on your mind.</p>

At LZX we are wrapping up an exhausting year, and probably our most challenging yet.  It has been difficult to speak publicly on our ongoing plans and projects with a mammoth in the room: Chromagnon is multiple years overdue, and I have failed to accurately estimate the shipping date a few times now.</p>
<p>Making this instrument possible has been a fight.  When circumstances have shifted and delays are suffered, I tend to freeze – preferring to bury myself in the work of pushing past the setbacks and hoping that I have better news to share later. As the months drag on, this leads to a lack of communication from us to you, and you are left with question marks, sparse information, and robbed of the choice to cheer us onward as we get closer.</p>
<p>So I’ve committed to regularly reporting the weather until we get this Chromagnon job done, and beyond.  I will be doing that through posting updates on this blog, whether there is notable progress or not.  In each post, I will try to answer any questions that you write in to <a href="mailto:sales@lzxindustries.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sales@lzxindustries.net</a>.</p>
<p>The intention is to make this an ongoing conversation and a camera angle behind the scenes -- rather than a sporadic update.</p>

<p><em>Chromagnon prototype testing on the Commodore 1702</em></p>
<p>In the next post, I’ll list our LZX stats sheet for 2023 – boards designed, goals met, projects shipped, dreams born, nightmares silenced.</p>
<p>But let’s end this one with an FAQ, and get that out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>When is Chromagnon shipping?</strong>  Knowing when exactly Chromagnon will ship is difficult to estimate. Our biggest obstacle at this stage is cashflow. The synthesizer market is volatile, and we may have to continue pivoting back and forth with other projects to keep the company going.  If there&#x27;s a last minute issue with the production articles or molded parts, that could also delay us by several weeks.  We are a few months behind the latest estimates represented by the production calendar, and our plan to be shipping by the end of 2023.  The milestone we are about to hit is where I wanted to be in September.  If plans go well, the first quarter of 2024 will encompass all of the activities remaining before we ship.  That includes validation of the production assembly, development of a production test platform, and production of the molded parts.</p>
<p><strong>What happened with Chromagnon in 2023?</strong> Low sales have hit the whole synth industry this year, and it required us to finish and ship several smaller projects (like our new module Scrolls) to make ends meet over the Summer and Fall.  It is a two steps forward, one step back situation – much like the past 3 years have been.  If we could throw all our time and resources at Chromagnon, we would -- but our survival mandates a balanced allocation. This is not a situation I like being in, but we are trying to make the best of whatever plan gets us closer to Chromagnon&#x27;s shipping day.</p>
<p><strong>Where is the Chromagnon demo video?</strong> I would prefer to not show the hardware output until the production first article passes our testing.  The current prototype represents a huge step toward completing the project, but it seems best to wait until it&#x27;s all 100% before investing time in filming a functional walkthrough.  After this week, production article testing is our next milestone to hit.  From that milestone, my R&amp;D workload lessens significantly, and filming an exhaustive video walkthrough becomes the priority.</p>
<p><strong>How is it going, Lars?!</strong> Outside of the beleaguered pre-order scenario, I am very happy with how Chromagnon has taken shape, and the past several weeks of work represent moving past the point of any remaining design issues and implementation decisions. It is still an instrumentation concept I am quite passionate about, and it has been very rewarding bringing it to life. I am grateful for the support and companionship of my teammates: Jonah, Chad, Ed, Nick and Andrew, who have stuck with LZX through some rough moments this year, and for my wife, kids and cats, who permit me to work long hours.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we are back to wrapping up the layout for this massive assembly, checking it twice, and getting some PCBs ordered before the holiday.</p>
